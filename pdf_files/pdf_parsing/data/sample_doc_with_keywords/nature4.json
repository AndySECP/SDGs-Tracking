["Results\nOur empirical analysis of the drivers of energy use patterns and car-\nbonization is based on data on population, gross domestic prod-\nuct (GDP), fuel-specific primary energy and CO2 emissions from \nthe International Energy Agency (IEA)15. This includes data for 24 \ncountries in SSA (another 25 are aggregated into Other Africa) for \nthe period 1971\u20132015. As the main focus of our analysis is on coun-\ntries that are building up their energy systems, we exclude South \nAfrica from the SSA aggregate.", "We then project the development of power sector emissions in \nthe near future, on the basis of the Platts database16, which provides \ncountry-level information on power plant capacities that already \nexist, are under construction or are in the planning process. Finally, \nwe compare these results with projected emissions in the Shared \nSocioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)17 that have been derived from \nintegrated assessment model studies. All data and methods are \ndescribed in more detail in the Supplementary Information.", "Economic development in sub-Saharan Africa has increased carbon emissions and will continue to do so. However, changes \nin emissions in the past few decades and their underlying drivers are not well understood. Here we use a Kaya decomposition \nto show that rising carbon intensity has played an increasingly important role in emission growth in sub-Saharan Africa since \n2005. These changes have mainly been driven by the increasing use of oil, especially in the transportation sector. Combining \ninvestment data in the power sector with economic and population projections, we find that investments in new coal-fired \ncapacity may become a major driver of future carbonization. Our results highlight the importance of making low-carbon tech-\nnologies available and financially attractive to sub-Saharan African countries to avoid a lock-in of emission-intensive energy \nuse patterns.", "Online content\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting \nsummaries, source data, extended data, supplementary informa-\ntion, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author \ncontributions and competing interests; and statements of data and \ncode availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-\n019-0649-8.", "Projected data. The projected data for 2025 result from combining three data \nsources by the IEA15, Platts16 and Shearer et\u00a0al., with a set of assumptions. A \nsummary diagram of the methodology used to compute the Kaya factors is \nprovided in Supplementary Fig. 1. For instance, GDP and population data over \n2005\u20132015 were taken from the IEA15 and were linearly extrapolated to 2025.", "The associated CO2 emissions were estimated using carbon intensities from \nthe previous periods for all fossil fuels. More specifically, the carbon intensities of \ncoal, oil and gas power plants are about 950, 850 and 400 g CO2 kWh\u22121, respectively. \nThese were computed using IEA data15 and were relatively constant between \n2000 and 2015. They are in good agreement with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for \nNational Greenhouse Gas Inventories35. In other words, CO2 emissions in 2025 are \ncalculated using the projected energy consumption in the power sector and other \nsectors multiplied by the relevant CO2 emission factors.", "On the basis of these data and assumptions, we generated two polar scenarios: \n30% and All. In 30%, we assumed that only 30% of the pre-construction coal power \nplant projects will be successful while all shelved projects will not. This assumption \nreflects historical rates as indicated in Shearer et\u00a0al.22 (Africa and the Middle East: \n27%, World: 34%; see Table 2 in the report). We also considered all coal power \nplants to run at 30% of their capacities, which is also in line with historical data \n(Supplementary Fig. 3). In All, we assumed that all planned coal plants (pre-\nconstruction and shelved) will successfully come online by 2025 and that all coal \nplants have a load factor of 48% (Supplementary Fig. 3). In both scenarios we also \nassumed that all coal power plants existing in the previous period are still operating \nand that all plants in construction will be fully operating in 2025. The assumptions \nunderlying these two scenarios cover a broad range of highly disputed values. The \nfuture will probably lie somewhere between the two scenarios. We emphasize, \nhowever, that our results indicate an influence on short-term emission growth in \ngeneral; that is, they do not necessarily depend on the year 2025 specifically but \nrather sometime around this year.", "Data availability\nThe data used in this study are not publically available (except Shearer et\u00a0al.22 and \nWirth34).
