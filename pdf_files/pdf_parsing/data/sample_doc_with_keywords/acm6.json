["Microsoft Kinect has been successfully used to reconstruct 3D meshes representing humans at real-time\nrates [Du et al. 2019]. However, our preliminary tests with Microsoft Kinect 2.0 showed that the thinness of\nthe catheter makes it hard to detect and track with commodity depth sensors. The shortcomings of infrared\ndepth sensing, in this case, are outside the scope of this work.1 Instead, we devise a new optical marker and\ntracking technique, suitable for augmented reality (AR). We label a portion of the catheter with three distinct\ncolors. One design principle we have observed after consulting our medical collaborators is making minimal\nchanges to the catheter. Our modification does not change the catheter in any way that would make it feel dif-\nferent to operate. We develop an algorithm to detect the color bands and then use them to calculate the position\nof the catheter. This way, even if the tip of the needle is occluded, we still know where it is and are able to\nvisualize it, as long as enough of the colored portion remains visible. We display a virtual catheter overlaid on\nthe real catheter directly in the user\u2019s field of view using a see-through Microsoft HoloLens, which allows the\nsurgeon to better focus on the patient while still having access to the relevant data and provides better depth\nperception and understanding of the operating context. We only need to do a one-time calibration to determine\nthe relation between the HoloLens and the camera. Testing shows that our system achieves high accuracy and\nlow latency. We also show the usefulness of our system in a realistic surgical environment on a cadaveric head.\nAn example of the view directly observed by the surgeon is shown in Figure 1."]
