["Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from the world\u2019s river net-\nworks constitute a poorly constrained term in the global N2O \nbudget1,2. This N2O component was previously estimated as \nindirect emissions from agricultural soils3 with large uncer-\ntainties4\u201310. Here, we present an improved model representa-\ntion of nitrogen and N2O processes of the land\u2013ocean aquatic \ncontinuum11 constrained with an ensemble of 11 data prod-\nucts. The model\u2013data framework provides a quantification \nfor how changes in nitrogen inputs (fertilizer, deposition and \nmanure), climate and atmospheric CO2 concentration, and \nterrestrial processes have affected the N2O emissions from \nthe world\u2019s streams and rivers during 1900\u20132016. The results \nshow a fourfold increase of global riverine N2O emissions \nfrom 70.4\u2009\u00b1\u200915.4\u2009Gg N2O-N\u2009yr\u22121 in 1900 to 291.3\u2009\u00b1\u200958.6\u2009Gg \nN2O-N\u2009yr\u22121 in 2016, although the N2O emissions started to \ndecline after the early 2000s. The small rivers in head water \nzones (lower than fourth-order streams) contributed up to \n85% of global riverine N2O emissions. Nitrogen loads on \nheadwater streams and groundwater from human activities, \nprimarily agricultural nitrogen applications, play an important \nrole in the increase of global riverine N2O emissions.", "the subgrid routine processes without conducting model simulation \nat fine resolution (Supplementary Fig. 1b). To quantify the influ-\nences of natural and human activities on riverine N2O emissions, \nthe model was driven by many factors including climate (shortwave \nradiation, precipitation, air temperature, maximum temperature \nand minimum temperature), land use and land cover, and nitro-\ngen inputs (fertilizer, deposition, manure and sewage) from 1900 \nto 2016 (Supplementary Fig. 2). The simulated river discharges and \nnitrate (NO3\u2212), ammonium (NH4+) and dissolved organic nitrogen \nconcentrations were calibrated using observations from 50 large \nriver basins across the globe (Supplementary Fig. 3). The simulated \ngroundwater-dissolved N2O concentration and riverine-dissolved \nN2O concentration agreed well with observations both spatially \nand temporally (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary  \nFigs. 4\u20136). To assess the uncertainty of riverine N2O emissions,  \nsix datasets of N inputs and five estimates of river surface area \n(Methods and Supplementary Fig. 7) were used to drive the model. \nThe average of the ensemble N2O outputs was taken as the best \nestimation. Moreover, factorial experiments (Fig. 1b) were con-\nducted to attribute the contribution of each factor (climate, CO2, \nfertilizer, manure and N deposition) to riverine N2O emissions \n(Supplementary Table 2).", "biogeochemical processes; measurements and driving data also \nneed to improve. In particular, model parameters were the largest \nsource of uncertainty, followed by river surface area and nitrogen \ninputs (Supplementary Fig. 7). A rainfall event can increase the sur-\nface area of the first-order streams greatly but the high flow veloci-\nties make surface area prediction difficult22. Gas exchange rates also \nshow large variations by streams which requires further investiga-\ntion30. We simulated the N2O production from nitrification and \ndenitrification using a Q10-based empirical method, in which water \ntemperature is the only determinant (the first-order mechanism). \nAlthough some deficits exist in this method to explicitly account \nfor other critical factors, such as carbon availability, microbe activ-\nity and the level of dissolved oxygen (Supplementary Fig. 7), the \nparameterization of nitrification and denitrification rates at the \nreference temperature does implicitly consider impacts of other \nfactors. Moreover, the method is further validated by this study \n(Supplementary Table 1)25. Currently, the process-based subsurface \nhydrodynamic model requires variables such as thickness or extent \nof the hyporheic zone, hyporheic denitrification rate21. However, \nthese variables remain highly uncertain due to the lack of field mea-\nsurements globally. Therefore, the rigorous interaction between \nprocess-based modelling and field experimentation will be essential \nto reduce estimate uncertainty in the lateral N2O emission for clos-\ning the global N2O budget.", "Online content\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting \nsummaries, source data, extended data, supplementary informa-\ntion, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author \ncontributions and competing interests; and statements of data and \ncode availability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-\n019-0665-8.", "\nLetters Nature Climate ChaNge\nmethods\nWe collected site-level observations of dissolved N2O concentration, riverine \nN2O flux and groundwater N2O concentration from literature, to calibrate and \nvalidate our riverine N2O model within the DLEM framework (Supplementary \nInformation).
