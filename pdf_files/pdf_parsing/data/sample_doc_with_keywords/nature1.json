["For generations, climate scientists have educated the public \nthat \u2018weather is not climate\u2019, and climate change has been \nframed as the change in the distribution of weather that slowly \nemerges from large variability over decades1\u20137. However, \nweather when considered globally is now in uncharted terri-\ntory. Here we show that on the basis of a single day of globally \nobserved temperature and moisture, we detect the fingerprint \nof externally driven climate change, and conclude that Earth as \na whole is warming. Our detection approach invokes statisti-\ncal learning and climate model simulations to encapsulate the \nrelationship between spatial patterns of daily temperature and \nhumidity, and key climate change metrics such as annual global \nmean temperature or Earth\u2019s energy imbalance. Observations \nare projected onto this relationship to detect climate change. \nThe fingerprint of climate change is detected from any single \nday in the observed global record since early 2012, and since \n1999 on the basis of a year of data. Detection is robust even \nwhen ignoring the long-term global warming trend. This \ncomplements traditional climate change detection, but also \nopens broader perspectives for the communication of regional \nweather events, modifying the climate change narrative: while \nchanges in weather locally are emerging over decades, global \nclimate change is now detected instantaneously.", "Formal D&A of externally forced signals in Earth\u2019s observed \nclimate relies on spatial patterns, so-called \u2018fingerprints\u2019, that \nencapsulate expected physical climate responses to external forc-\ning7. We extend an established fingerprint detection method11,13,17 \nby incorporating a regression method that improves the separa-\ntion of signal and noise based on daily data (see Methods and \nExtended Data Fig. 1). First, we define two key climate change \nmetrics, annual global mean temperature (AGMT) and a decadal \naverage of Earth\u2019s energy imbalance (EEI), that serve as target \nvariables for detection. AGMT characterizes climate warming \nfrom a surface perspective, used in policy assessments18,19, while \nEEI characterizes the state of climate change from a more physi-\ncally motivated energy balance perspective20,21. Second, we train \nregularized linear regression models, using ridge regression, \nthat predict each of the two targets from daily spatial patterns of \nsurface temperature and/or humidity for each month and based  \non model simulations in the Coupled Model Intercomparison \nProject Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model archive driven by external \nforcing. This step yields fingerprints as maps of regression coef-\nficients that encapsulate the relationship between global patterns \nof daily weather and each target metric while reducing \u2018noise\u2019 in \nregions with large internal variability or model disagreement. \nFinally, and similarly to established detection methods11,13,17, \nwe project observations onto the model-derived fingerprints to \nobtain a prediction of each target metric. We then assess whether \nexternally forced climate change is detected by testing against the \nnull hypothesis that the predicted test statistic is indistinguishable \nfrom natural variability.", "To understand the spatial signature of externally forced climate \nchange in daily data, we discuss AGMT fingerprints and their sea-\nsonal cycle, which reveals key climatological features (Fig. 2a,b). \nFirst, regression coefficients are positive throughout the globe, indi-\ncating that the fingerprints pick up a global warming signal. Second, \ncoefficients are larger over the oceans than over land, and larger over \nthe tropics than over mid- or high latitudes. These features illustrate \nthat signal-to-noise ratios of forced climate change in daily data \nare higher over the oceans than over land, and higher in the trop-\nics than over mid- or high-latitudes, consistent with our physical  \nunderstanding of forced changes on longer timescales23,24.

We use two key climate change metrics as target variables, AGMT  \n(in the year y that corresponds to the day i at which climate change is to be \ndetected) and EEI (as a decadal average in the years before y). These two metrics \nare key indicators of climate change (AGMT18,19; EEI20,21) and serve here as target \nvariables (that is, the one-dimensional test statistic) for climate change detection \nat the daily timescale. The method is conceptually similar to a machine learning \napproach to fingerprint extraction used recently to determine emergence times \nof climate change based on yearly data30. In a first step, the fingerprint of external \nforcing is extracted from forced model simulations such that the p-dimensional \nspatial pattern of daily temperature or humidity is related linearly to one of the \ntarget metrics (denoted here, Ymod) in a regression setting (step (1) in Extended \nData Fig. 1):", "We extract model simulations from the CMIP5 multi-model archive36 for \ntraining. Simulations are extracted for 24 different models from 13 modelling \ncentres that provide daily surface temperature and specific humidity (see \nSupplementary Table 1). The model data consist of in total 14,100 individual \nmodel years available for fingerprint extraction, where three days per month are \nchosen for training: the 5th, 15th and 25th day of each month (corresponding \nto 507,600 days). The 14,100 model years are made up of 45 simulations using \nthe historical (1870\u20132005; that is, in total 6,120 model years) and Representative \nConcentration Pathway (RCP)8.5 scenario (2006\u20132100, 4,815 model years), \nand 39 simulations with the RCP2.6 scenario (2006\u20132100, 3,705 model years). \nWe regrid all daily model data to a common, regular 5\u00b0 \u00d7 5\u00b0 spatial grid (that is, \ncorresponding to p = 2,592 grid cells or spatial predictors). Next, we subtract the \nseasonal cycle from each day i, separately for each model and for each grid cell p, \nusing a 31-d rolling mean seasonal cycle centred on the respective day. The 31-d \nrolling mean seasonal cycle is estimated from the 1979\u20132005 reference period. \nThe 1979\u20132005 reference period is chosen to maximize the overlap between \nmodel simulations with historical forcing (that end in 2005) and observations \n(some of which start only in 1979, see next paragraph), and to ensure an identical \nprocessing and hence comparability between model simulations and observations. \nThe target metrics are obtained similarly for each model. AGMT denotes the \nanomaly of the annual mean spatial average of surface temperatures (in the year \nthat corresponds to day i), and is estimated separately for each model relative to its \n1979\u20132005 average. The second target metric, EEI, denotes the energy imbalance \nat the top of the atmosphere20, estimated as a decadal average in the decade before \nthe year that corresponds to day i. Net top-of-atmosphere radiation is sensitive \nto drift in CMIP5 models40,41, but the drift is approximately constant in each \nmodel40,41. Therefore, we implement a standard mean drift correction of net top-of-\natmosphere radiation (corresponding to a linear drift in Earth\u2019s energy content40) \nby estimating the mean drift in long-term control simulations in each model. \nSubsequently, we subtract the mean drift from each model\u2019s EEI estimates.", "Next, we train the regularized linear model to extract the respective \nfingerprints. For this purpose, an individual statistical model (that is, fingerprint) is \ntrained for each month, because the expected physical response to external forcing \nchanges with the seasonal cycle13 (for example, Fig. 2). To increase the sample size \nfor training of each individual month, samples from the previous and subsequent \nmonth are included in the training step. We implement a standard cross-validation \nscheme to determine the ridge regression parameter (\u03bb) and to extract the final \nfingerprints. Cross-validation is standard practice in statistical learning and \nensures, by splitting the raw dataset into separate partitions, that model fitting and \nmodel validation and selection are performed on different data (to avoid a biased \nperformance evaluation). From a climate science perspective, cross-validation as ", "\nLettersNaTurE ClimaTE CHaNgE\nimplemented here with a \u2018leave-one-model-out\u2019 strategy can be seen as an iterative \nperfect model approach. First, in an outer loop, we run 13 simulations (k = 13) \nfor which each individual climate model is iteratively left out as an unseen test \nset. Second, we determine the ridge regression parameter \u03bb in an inner loop by \nk \u2212 1-fold cross-validation. That is, each of the 13 training simulations uses data \nfrom k \u2212 1 = 12 climate models (that is, one model left out iteratively), where each \nmodel is put in a separate fold (\u2018leave-one-model-out cross-validation\u2019). This \nstep ensures that the fingerprints extrapolate well to an unseen model (that is, \nfingerprints that are robust across the CMIP5 multi-model archive). In cases where \nmodelling centres provide separate variants of a particular model (Supplementary \nTable 1), these model variants are treated as part of the same model and hence put \nin the same fold. We ensure that each model used in the training step receives the \nsame weight by subsampling the number of individual days used for training.  \nThe tuning parameter \u03bb is then selected in the cross-validation as the most \nregularized model within one standard error of the minimum mean squared \nerror on the out-of-fold data. This yields a fingerprint (\u03b3\u0302k) as a set of regression \ncoefficients. Third, for each of the 13 simulations (that is, iteratively for each test \nset model not used in the inner loop), we predict the respective target metric \nfor any given day i. These independent estimates of the target metric are used to \nestimate prediction errors (that is, the RMSEs discussed in the main text) and \n1870\u20131950 predictions are used as a reference distribution of the test statistic  \nunder \u2018natural variability\u2019. The choice of the 1870\u20131950 period for the control \ndistribution is conservative, because some of the early-twentieth-century warming \nmay have been externally forced28 in addition to internal variability. Last, the final \nfingerprint (\u03b3\u0302, shown in Fig. 2), for any given month, is obtained by averaging  \nover the 13 separate fingerprints (\u03b3\u0302k) of the outer loop.", "This set-up is repeated for both climate change target metrics (AGMT and \nEEI), and for different sets of predictors. The different sets of predictors include  \nthe daily spatial pattern of (1) temperature (\u2018Temp.\u2019); (2) temperature, where  \nthe global mean temperature of each day is removed from each grid cell  \n(\u2018Temp.\u2019, mean removed); (3) specific humidity, using the mask of an observational \ndataset42 available over land (\u2018Hum.

We use the Met Office HadISDH gridded global land surface \nhumidity dataset42 (spanning 1973\u20132017), which features a reasonable coverage \nof global land areas. We mask the dataset to all grid cells that have a coverage of at \nleast 95% in time.
