{"9NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION |  1201 16TH ST., NW, WASHINGTON, D.C. 20036Teacher Assessment and Evaluationteacher assessment and evaluation systems consider including value-added measures only within a clear and meaningful system of multiple measures of evidence.USING MULTIPLE MEASURES Education analysts now commonly accept the notion that using multiple measures of student learning and teacher effectiveness is a necessary component of teacher assessment and evaluation. However, the current political environment has contributed to a misconstruing of this notion. Some school districts have used student achievement, often measured by a single test, as the key measure of teacher effectiveness. In some instances, student achievement has accounted for 50 percent of a teacher\u2122s evaluation. Such myopic reliance on a single measure fails to capture the complexities and nuances of teaching. It also fails to recognize the wide range of ways in which teachers contribute to student growth and learning.  To be effective, a teacher assessment and evaluation system must employ a carefully constructed set of multiple measures. At NEA\u2122s Multiple Measures of Student Learning Working Group meeting in August 2010, Laura Goe identi\u02dced several speci\u02dcc bene\u02dcts of such an approach. For example, she said the use of multiple measures strengthens teacher evaluation by providing a more complete picture of a teacher\u2122s contribution to student learning; by increasing con\u02dcdence in the results of a teacher\u2122s evaluation; and by increasing the information available about collaboration for student success.Goe also said the use of a carefully constructed set of multiple measures contributes to teachers\u2122 professional growth by creating opportunities for teachers to learn from their colleagues, and by providing teachers with greater insight into how their instruction is affecting student learning.Furthermore, the use of appropriate multiple measures sets the stage for improved teaching and learning by offering more complete evidence about student learning growth, particularly in areas where students are not tested; by offering more complete evidence of learning growth for English language learners and students with disabilities; and by contributing to a comprehensive view of students\u2122 strengths and weaknesses.EXAMPLES OF MULTIPLE MEASURESThe following examples identify multiple measures of student learning and multiple measures of teacher effectiveness that could be integrated into a comprehensive teacher evaluation system:Multiple measures of student growth and learning: Standardized test scores are only one indicator of student growth and learning and should not be the primary source of information used for measuring student growth. Other forms of evidence and data include: Local and district-wide achievement test resultsStudent work that shows evidence of student growth Subject matter assessments Students\u2122 oral and written presentations  Learning goals developed by the teacher or principal Project-based inquiry activities Teacher-generated information about student growth and goals Formative and summative student assessments Evaluations of effective engagement, critical thinking, self-ef\u02dccacy or a combination thereof.Multiple measures of teacher effectiveness: Student learning data should not be the only signi\u02dccant source of information for measuring teacher performance, nor should it be the primary source.
