{"CHAPTER IV  RESULTS  Analysis of the results is presented under the following three subtitles: (1) rate of return, (2) research questions, and (3) secondary findings.  Research data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences: Graduate Pack 11.0 for Windows (SPSS, 2001).  Rate of Return A database was compiled consisting of data provided by surveys distributed to participants in environmental education programs throughout the school systems in three Southwest Florida counties: Lee, Charlotte, and Hendry. From a total of 802 surveys, 488 instruments were returned representing a 60.8 % return. The percentages of return per group were: environmental specialists (49.1 %), H.S. instructors (88.2 %), H.S. students (61.4 %), and parents (60.8 %). From the total of 55 surveys issued to the environmental specialists group 27 were returned, one survey was returned unanswered. The responses of H.S. instructors, H.S. students and parents were collected from 7 high schools in Southwest Florida. From 365 surveys issued to H.S. students, 224 were returned and 5 surveys were returned unanswered. Parents were issued the same amount of surveys (365) returning 222 surveys and 17 not answered.
