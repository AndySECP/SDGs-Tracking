{"Table 5.1-2. Agriculture Model Assumptions Assumption Notes Feedstock Production U.S. national average corn yields are approximately 170 bu/acre in 2017 and 180 bu/acre in 2022 (a 1.6% annual increase over the baseline year) Consistent with USDA projections (http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/oce081/) U.S. national average soybean yields are approximately 50 bu/acre in 2022 (a 0.4% annual increase) International corn yields increasing over time, for example: Argentina ~140 bu/acre in 2022 (a 0.8% annual increase) Brazil ~68 bu/acre in 2022 (a 1.1% annual increase) FAPRI Models International soybean yields increasing over time, for example: Argentina ~48 bu/acre in 2022 (a 0.7% annual increase) Brazil ~50 bu/acre in 2022 (a 1.1% annual increase) Corn residue removal rates of 50% are allowed for no till practices; 35% removal rate allowed for reduced till practices (no removal from conventional till) Derived from Graham et. al., Agronomy Journal, 99:1\u015211 (2007). \ufb01Current and Potential U.S. Corn Stover Supplies.\ufb02  and Perlack, R.
