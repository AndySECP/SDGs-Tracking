{" 45In order to analyze this rotating field in this way, which will be referred to as the expected ellipse algorithm, the following steps are performed: 1. The average maximum and minimum magnetic field intensities and any angle of rotation of the field are determined. 2. An ellipse approximating the rotating magnetic field is generated from this information. 3. Ellipses for the minimum and maximum allowable values of the magnetic field intensity based on allowable percentage deviation from the average must be created from the approximation; these are used to detect any sort of abnormal behavior.  Similar to the Cartesian coordinate ellipse discussed in Section 3.1, the polar coordinate ellipse which can be generated from the information about the maximum rho, minimum rho, and shifted angle is defined by   shiftshift22min22maxminmaxcossin  (65)where  is the predicted value of rho for any given value of  (based on the value of  for any data point), max and min are the detected maximum and minimum values of rho, and shift is the detected rotational shift of the ellipse. Once this ellipse is constructed, it is used in determining allowable maximum and minimum magnetic fields. An example elliptical rotating magnetic field with several boundaries of allowable values of rho for given values of theta is shown below in Figure 4-2; the actual magnetic field is shown in bold. While values of max and min are indicated, it should be noted that values of max and min also occur at the points 180 around the ellipse from the indicated points. The boundary which is significantly larger than the actual ellipse (the maximum ":0}
