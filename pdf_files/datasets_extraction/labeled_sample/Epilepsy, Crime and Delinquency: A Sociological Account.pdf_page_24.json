SOURCE: U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1973, table 3. Criminal justice agencies have been taking credit for the achievement of this drop in crime rates without acknowledging the contribution of demographic trends to its accomplishment. The birth rate in the United States has been fickle. During the thirties, apparently due to the great depression, it declined sharply. Even the great pioneer of futurology in the social sciences, the late William Fielding Ogburn, projected this shift as permanent when he told my undergraduate class at the University of Chicago in 1938 that the popUlation of the United States would level off in the last half of the 20th century at around 160 million people. Instead, of course, the birth rate rose again and we reached 203 million in the 1970 Census (plus an estimated 5.3 million uncounted). It follows that the projections in table 3.5 must be taken with some caution in any planning ahead for more than a decade or two. The current decline in the birth rate of the United States seems rooted in the prolongation of adolescence, as well as in spread of contraception and abortion practices, but one of its consequences is greater deferral of commitment to a specific career in adulthood. Concomitantly, there have been changes in attitudes towards stability of marriage and towards traditional forms of family life. Also probable in the remainder of the 20th century, due to our lower birth rate and continuing demand for cheap labor, is a growing influx of legal and illegal poor migrants from high birth rate areas of Latin America, and 39 , \" ":0}
