{"  48 illuminator (SYNGENE System, Cambridge, UK), and a picture created using a GeneSnap computer program (Cambridge, UK). Sensitivity of the assay using pure bacteria culture One C. jejuni strain (ADPH861) was used for the sensitivity analysis.  After being recovered from frozen stock and grown on mCC plates for 24h, the bacteria were suspend in PBS buffer with an OD value of 1.0 at 600 nm.  The suspension was serially diluted in pre-warmed 1x sterile PBS.  Each dilution was spread-plated on mCC plates (100 l) with three replicates made for each dilution.  DNA was extracted using PrepMan Ultra Sample Preparation Reagent (Applied Biosystems, Froster City, CA), and were serially diluted (5-fold) in nuclease-free water.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  Specificity of the assay Six different strains of C. jejuni, five strains C. coli, one strain of C. lari and one strain of C. fetus were included in the specificity test.  All the C. jejuni strains were tested positive (Fig.4.1A) and all non-C. jejuni were negative.  Twenty isolates from retail samples were also examined using the present method (Fig.4.2A).  The results were in agreement with those from other typing methods (data not shown).  Gel electrophoresis indicated that all positive samples have a band at187bp, no visible band observed for negative samples. (Fig.4.1B; Fig.4.2B).  These results indicated that the primer-probe set was highly specific to C. jejuni and the current PCR assay was able to identify the C. jejuni from the enrichments of spiked chicken meat samples.
