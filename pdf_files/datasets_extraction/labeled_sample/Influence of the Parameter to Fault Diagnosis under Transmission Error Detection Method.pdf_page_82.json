{" 72networked with other protection equipment and thus would be aware of the status of the transmission line. 4.2.6. Fault Analysis  After the end of the available data, any faults are analyzed using Equations (60), (61), and (62); prior to this, the information was only stored and was not processed. For each fault, timing information may be available from any of the algorithms which detected it. In order to obtain the most accurate measurement possible, the earliest available detection times for each fault are used in the calculation of the fault location. The location of the faults and the approximated times at which they occurred are then presented along with the information about the type of change that caused the fault to be detected. If any fault location calculations result in a negative distance, the times resulting in these errors are presented. As described in Section 4.2.2, a bit of leeway is given in waiting between the detection of a fault at one end of the transmission line and the latest expected fault detection time at the other end (at which time the information about the detection of the fault at the first end of the transmission line is discarded). These negative distance calculations may be the result of a fault very close to one end of the transmission line and late fault detection at the other end of the transmission line which falls within this leeway. The resulting negative distance can thus indicate a fault very close to one end of the transmission line. Additionally, any of the problem times  where a fault was clearly detected at one end of the transmission line but nothing was detected at the other end  are shown ":0}
