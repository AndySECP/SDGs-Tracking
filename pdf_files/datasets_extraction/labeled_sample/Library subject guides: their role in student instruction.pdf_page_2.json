{"  Potential Hurdles The literature on research guides has shown that they are often ignored by students and faculty (Ouelette 2011). Creating research guides can be time-using them, there may not be enough return on investment to justify the effort. Marketing and determining how to make guides available at creation itself. Looking at how to embed guides into online courseware, get faculty to recommend guides to their students, and linking students to the guides in relevant places in the online and physical world is key.    While research guide software gives anyone the ability to add instructional content to the web, the downside of this is that many of the librarians creating instructional content are not well-versed in web usability principles. Problems with design, information architecture and terminology are noted in the literature as common problems with research guide usability. Ouelette (2011) found that students were often overwhelmed by the amount of content provided within a guide. A number of usability studies have been done at libraries for their own research guides (MIT, University of Michigan, University of Washington, and Concordia University to name a few) and these provide useful tips though no definitive list of best practices currently exists. In order to provide a consistent and positive user experience, libraries should consider developing best practices to guide their staff.  Librarians also frequently develop guides without necessarily knowing what students want or need only used database links while Sinkinson, et al. (2012) found that students had a strong interest in research strategy-focused content, such as how to develop keywords or refine a topic. Interests will likely differ by subject area, level and institution, so th students and faculty to determine what will meet their unique needs.   Conclusion Given the growth of online learning and online library resources, research guides have the potential to provide valuable and targeted research instruction to students wherever they are. The challenges for libraries lie in selecting the right technology for their specific needs, designing the guides based on usability principle, determining developing strategies to increase their visibility.
