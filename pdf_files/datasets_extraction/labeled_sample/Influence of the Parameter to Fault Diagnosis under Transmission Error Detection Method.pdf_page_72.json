{" 62 Figure 4-16  Fault Detection Algorithm Convert from horizontal and vertical magnetic field intensities to polar coordinates; initialize variables; check if rho is increasing or decreasing    Determine if any previous (single end of the transmission line) fault detections were erroneous Check for rho maxes and mins and reset boundaries if needed  Test for any faults Reset maximum delta rho if near a point halfway between a rho max and rho min Test for any faults Adjust allowable margins for fault detection if necessary Test for any faults Delta Rho Algorithm Previous Value Algorithm Expected Ellipse Algorithm If faults are detected at both ends, store the related information If more than one algorithm has detected a fault, store this information separately  Is more data available? Yes No  Analyze results and compute fault locations (if any) If faults are detected at both ends, store the related information If faults are detected at both ends, store the related information  Reset maximum or minimum delta theta values if near a max or min change in theta Test for any faults Delta Theta Algorithm If faults are detected at both ends, store the related information ":0}
