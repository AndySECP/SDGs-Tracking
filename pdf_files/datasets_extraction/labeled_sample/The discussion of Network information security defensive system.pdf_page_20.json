{"Recommended Best Practice: Defense in Depth running on a control system computer, a return connection must be established from the control network. With regards to attacking resources in the control system domain, exploit code must be small and contain just enough code to get an attacker onto the target computer, as there is generally not enough space to add logic onto the device for the attacker to get advanced functionality. Therefore, additional instructions are needed from the attacker to continue with the discovery portion of the attack. If outbound filtering is implemented correctly, the attacker will not receive this return connection and cannot discover and control the exploited machine.11Creating Demilitarized Zones (DMZs)Network segmentation has traditionally been accomplished by using multiple routers. Firewalls should be used to create DMZs to protect the control network. Multiple DMZs could also be created for separate functionalities and access privileges, such as peer connections, the data historian, the Inter Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP) server in SCADA systems,the security servers, replicated servers, and development servers. Figure 7 shows a robust architecture with multiple DMZ deployments.Figure 7 \u2013 Architecture with DMZ deployments11 www.niscc.gov.uk/niscc/docs/re-20050223-00157.pdf20":0}
