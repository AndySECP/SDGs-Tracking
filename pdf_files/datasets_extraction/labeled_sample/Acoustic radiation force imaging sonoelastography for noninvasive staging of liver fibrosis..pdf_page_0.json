His-METAVIR scoring system served as the reference. A to-tal of 74 patients underwent ARFI elastography, APRI index, FibroMax and successful liver biopsy. RESULTS: The noninvasive tests had a good correlation with the liver biopsy results. The most powerful test in predicting fibrosis was ARFI elastography. The diagnostic accuracy of ARFI elastography, expressed as area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) had a validity of 90.2% (95% CI AUROC = 0.831-0.972, P 2). ARFI sonoelastography predicted even better F3 or F4 fibrosis (AUROC = 0.993, 95% CI = 0.979-1).CONCLUSION: ARFI elastography had very good superior to other noninvasive methods (APRI Index, \u00a9 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng.

This is particularly true in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), which is the leading cause of cirrhosis in many countries. CHC progresses to cirrhosis through a sequence of morphological changes that [1]. Staging systems of varying complexity based on these morphological changes have been used in patient management as a guide to prognosis, and in clinical investigations as an estimate of natural history and response to therapy.
