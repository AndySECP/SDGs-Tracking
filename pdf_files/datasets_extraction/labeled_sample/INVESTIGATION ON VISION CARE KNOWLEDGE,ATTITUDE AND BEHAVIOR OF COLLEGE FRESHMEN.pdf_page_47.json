{"Research Questions Research Question Number One: What are the levels of awareness, knowledge, and attitude (AKA) of environmental specialists and H.S. instructors who teach components of environmental education (EE) in their curriculum?  The data were collected from the environmental specialists and H.S. instructors groups because both groups represented the population of environmental educators in Southwest Florida. The mean percentages (with standard deviations in parenthesis) for the environmental specialists\u2122 awareness, knowledge, and attitude were 69.4% (7.87), 70.4% (12.08), and 78.2% (10.03) respectively. The H.S. instructors group returned 15 surveys out of 17 surveys issued. Their mean percentages (and standard deviations) for awareness, knowledge, and attitude were 61.2% (16.98), 69.1% (21.25), and 73.1% (22.23) respectively. Table 2 summarizes the descriptive statistics for these groups.  Table 2. Descriptive Statistics for AKA in Environmental Specialists and High School Instructors  Group NMeanStd. DeviationStd.

There was no statistically significant difference between the means of scores for knowledge (t= .250, df= 42, p> .05) and attitude (t= 1.035, df= 42, p> .05). However, the mean percentages for awareness were statistically significantly  36":1}
