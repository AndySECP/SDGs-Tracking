{" 434.  Analysis Using the Magnetic Field  As previously stated, the most obvious coordinate system to analyze a rotating magnetic field is a polar coordinate system, since any changes in the expected total magnetic field will be detected most easily this way. Four algorithms are presented in this section for the detection of faults while examining the system in polar coordinates. All of them involve detecting if the values of rho or theta have exceeded or gone below a set of expected boundaries or have made a significant and unexpected change.  Since each of these algorithms has a possibility of incorrectly detecting a fault, the results of these algorithms can be analyzed collectively to better determine whether or not a fault has truly occurred. Also, by taking the earliest fault detection times from each algorithm, the microprocessor which is performing this analysis will be able to determine actual fault detection times more correctly in order to perform the fault location more accurately. As a result, this combined analysis using all of these algorithms will provide a reduced number of false alarms as well as more accurate fault location. 4.1. Analysis Algorithms  The four algorithms used in this analysis detect the steady-state magnetic field behavior then determine any deviation from it. The first algorithm estimates the ellipse formed by the magnetic field then detects any significant deviations from this locus. The next algorithm compares the present value of rho to the value detected a fraction of a cycle before it and determines if too significant of a change has taken place. The third algorithm detects the maximum change in rho between data points every quarter cycle and determines if the change in rho between the last two data points has exceeded a ":0}
