Research, development and marketing are in balance.  Coupling model: interactions between the different elements and feedback between them  Parallel model: integration between the companies, linking with key suppliers and active customers, emphasis on bindings and alliances, system integration, large networks, flexible and tailored response to continuous innovation.  Network model: system integration, wide networks, flexible and tailored reactions of radical innovations.  The transformation from traditional, closed innovation to modern, open and performed within the network, is not without problems. Trend is to work also with partners with not clearly and poorly structured problems related to innovation, comprehensive thinking on innovation with a strong focus on future developments and the possible needs of potential users. The challenging tasks of design of innovation processes in the network are:  Knowledge of integration across the organizations  Format of partnership for innovation in the network  Identification of strategic partners  Balancing the goals and future vision for innovation in the network  Team structures for innovation in the network  Skills and practices for innovation networks  Model for network innovation  3. Innovation Techniques and Tools Integration Approach for an Effective Product Design  Experience from development projects proved that for innovation process in the field of automotive components is the integrated portfolio of innovation methods and techniques an excellent way to gain the benefits of lean approach. The recipe for successful portfolio mixture must consist of four essential ingredients:  1. Analytic innovation methods and techniques  They are intended for gathering and evaluation of source data for innovation process and its particular phases launch, including i.a.:   Surveys: marketing surveys for future product users, surveys for branch experts, etc. As a tool of open and user innovation they are helping to refine the product innovation according to user needs and demands. In combination with taking the opinions or suggestions branch specialists into account provide the unique tool to adjust the product bespoke target user groups and assure the competitive success.  Benchmarking of competitive products. Helps development teams become familiar with the bill of materials, part count, features etc. of competitive products in the appropriate segments in order to understand how to improve the engineering and/or design of the product and trends in the area. The more complex, detailed and numerous (in terms of examined competitive products) the benchmarking is, the in order to explore and identify key differentiating features as the optional areas for improvements.       Innovation intelligence focused on inspiration suggestions (product architecture, new functions, materials, technologies, fields of application, etc.) partially utilizes benchmarking results, which, combined with new knowledge can be the source of new innovation ideas.  2. Creative methods and techniques  In the beginning of the innovation process are used to generating innovation ideas, their evaluation and transformation to innovation opportunities, and also in concept creation. Some of them play in the next phases the role of stimulating pulses for subsequent appropriate outputs routine. Here belongs a number of methods and techniques, i.a.:  ":0}
