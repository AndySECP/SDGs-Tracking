{"27 The measured cross-section for production of these levels was about two orders of magnitude lower. As expected, the yield at 97 Mev. of a delayed proton precursor was greater when produced (p,d2n) and (p,p3n) re-actions than by a (p13n) reaction. 2. Final Results The results quoted in the remainder of this chap-ter represent the most up to date analysis of observed delayed proton precursors. Using the apparatus designed for bombardment of targets in the internai beam of the cyclotron, more precise data was acquired forithe delayed proton precursors Nel7, Mg21 and Si25. For each of these, improved resolution spectra allow-ed a more detailed analysis of the decay schemes using standard spectroscopie techniques. Previously estimated Q values for the beta decay of Ne17, Mg21 and Si25 allowed calculation of the thresholds for tbeir production via proton induced reactions in the nearest corresponding stable isotopes. The measured thresbolds for tbeir production in the various targets showed good agreement witb the ca)culations and served as a primary metbod of iden-ti fi cation. Except for ol3, tbe beta-decay balf-life of eacb precursor was measured observing the half-life for decay of prominent peaks in its delayed proton spectrum. Narrow peaks of strong intensity were observed in the delayed proton spectra of Mg21 and Si25\u0141 Tbese peaks bave ":0}
