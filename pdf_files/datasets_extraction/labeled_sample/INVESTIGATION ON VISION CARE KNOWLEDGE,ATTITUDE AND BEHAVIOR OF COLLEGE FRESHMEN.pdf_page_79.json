{"Similarly, the current findings may be of interest to various government agencies, since the data represents a sample of the environmental AKA in adult populations of three counties in Southwest Florida. For example, environmental issues have been identified as key factors in local political races. Also, increased media attention has been given to the impact of growth and development on the region. Measures of AKA may be valuable to local policy makers as decisions are made that result in an environmental impact. Recommendations for Additional Research  Environmental education is currently in the curriculum of all state of Florida schools and educational institutions. There is an interest among public policy makers in local communities, the private sector, and local governments to develop effective EE programs as related to local concerns such as smart growth development. An essential component of program development is a valid evaluation tool. The instrument utilized in this study investigated the levels of three of the most common objectives, AKA, in EE as measured by environmental education researchers. In order to refine the instrument, it is recommended that the study undergo a more rigorous statistical analysis beyond the scope of this investigation to determine relationships among the dependent factors and the participating groups.  While research in the field of EE and has focused on students who are in the last years of high school, little is known about their AKA levels in the long term, that is, after enrolling in higher education, the workforce, or establishing a family.
