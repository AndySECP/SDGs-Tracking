{"Recommended Best Practice: Defense in Depth The new protocols and communication standards that are providing increased interoperabilityand control in the control system community are the same technologies that have been exploited and compromised in the Internet and networking domains. Historically, control system security meant locating and identifying problems in a closed-loop system; now unauthorized intrusion or attacks are evolving issues to be addressed.Figure 1 illustrates the traditional separation of corporate architectures and control domains. This architecture provided means for data sharing, data acquisition, peer-to-peer data exchange, and other business operations. However, the security of any given system was based on the fact that few, if any, understood the intricate architecture or the operational mechanics of the resources on the controls system LAN. This \u2018security by obscurity\u2019 works well for environments that have no external communication connections which allow an organization to focus on physical security.Figure 1 \u2013 Traditional isolation of corporate and control domains 4":0}
