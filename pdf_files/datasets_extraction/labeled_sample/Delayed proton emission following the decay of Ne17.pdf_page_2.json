{"iii as 1939 and were first identified among nuclides with large neutron excess which were produced as fission fragments of heavy nuclei. Delayed proton are a recent discovery in which the writer participated and have been ed only proton induced reactions in stable nuclides using the lOO Mev McGill synchrocyclotron. The identification of new artificially produced radioactive nuclides usually proceeds using the techniques of chemistry and reaction Q values in conjunction with beta and gamma ray spectroscopy. Nuclides far from the region of bility, however, prove difficult to identify since the high energy required for their production allows many reaction end products with the consequent problem of separating the vities. Many of the highly neutron deficient nuelides for whieh delayed proton emission is energetically possible have been predieted to exist but none have been experimentally tified prior to this research. Proton emission, typically less than 10 Mev in energy, following the beta deeay of these nuelides is easily distinguished from other radiations use of solid state teetors. The fitting of observed proton energies to expeeted transition energies derived from previously reported resonant reaction data becomes a eonvenient spectroscopie tool. The half-lives, all of the order of 100 msee, of the delayed proton precursors identified in this research have been measured observing the decay of proton activity ":0}
