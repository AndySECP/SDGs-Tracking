First, that the input assumptions are based on the most current data and projections available in government, industry, and academia; and second, to ensure that the two agriculture models, FASOM and FAPRI, were analyzing similar real-world assumptions, and thus present a detailed and consistent worldwide analysis.  Table 5.1-2 lists some of the key assumptions associated with the agriculture sector modeling, as well as the source for these assumptions.  Additional details on the assumptions included in FASOMPPPPPPPPPP and FAPRIQQQQQQQQQQ are included in the docket. A series of information was gathered from and reviewed by other government agencies, such as USDA and DOE. These include corn and soybean yields,RRRRRRRRRR corn ethanol dry and wet mill plant processing energy use, corn ethanol yields, corn ethanol by-product use, and estimated corn stover yields.  For other assumptions, we relied on external expertise, such as FAPRI; the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model;SSSSSSSSSS the Assessment System for Population Exposure Nationwide (ASPEN) model;TTTTTTTTTT and the Agriculture Resource Management Survey (ARMS).UUUUUUUUUU PPPPPPPPPP Beach, Robert; McCarl, Bruce, Agricultural Impacts of the Energy Independence and Security Act: FASOM Results and Model Description, RTI International, October, 2008.

GREET can simulate more than 100 fuel production pathways and more than 80 vehicle/fuel systems.TTTTTTTTTT ASPEN is a computer simulation model used to estimate toxic air pollutant concentrations is called the Assessment System for Population Exposure Nationwide, or. This model is based on the EPA\u2122s Industrial Source Complex Long Term model (ISCLT) which simulates the behavior of the pollutants after they are emitted into the atmosphere. ASPEN uses estimates of toxic air pollutant emissions and meteorological data from National Weather Service Stations to estimate air toxics concentrations nationwide.
