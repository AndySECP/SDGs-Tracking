{"the face of this problem, the tire can be tested and positioned by the tire special inspection technology. The camera is used to detect the tire, and the tire is automatically divided into 8 sections. The camera can be aligned with a section to realize the equipment. Detect and automatically inflate the car tires. The camera can record the contraction and expansion state of the surface of the car tire; after all the sections are detected, the shrinkage rate and the expansion ratio are analyzed according to the state of the camera. After accurate calculation and analysis, if the parameter index exceeds the standard range, the surface car can be surfaced. There is a crack in a certain part of the tire, and new car tires must be replaced in time to prevent serious traffic accidents. 3.3 Sensing and Display Technology With the continuous development of technology, the test bench for automotive testing has also undergone tremendous changes, mainly to improve the sensing and display technology, using high-precision, high-sensitivity sensors as sensing elements, and display methods are more standardized. Clear and clear, able to provide accurate position and accurate data for the maintenance process. Linear and high precision sensing and display technology plays a big role in the four-wheel alignment detection technology. The sensor can position the side of the wheel of the car. The reference, the four-wheel XE position is driven by the drum, in order to keep the parameters stable, independent of the wheel adjustment, the wheel can be detected while keeping dynamic, and the test data is more than before. Accurate and effective, improving the efficiency of modern car testing. 3.4 Emission Detection Emissions detection The basic function of this technology is to detect whether the actual emissions of the vehicle can meet certain requirements or standards, so as not to endanger the surrounding ecological environment. Effectively control vehicle emissions by means of automobile assembly lines and technical measures such as mandatory inspection and control of emissions. Through the emission detection technology, emission regulation can be realized for all processes of passenger vehicles from the factory to the end of life, so as to achieve environmental protection. 4. ANALYSIS OF SAFETY MANAGEMENT MEASURES FOR MODERN CARS  4.1 Implementation of Relevant Safety Management Responsibilities Strict implementation of relevant safety management responsibilities is a top priority. Strictly implement the safety responsibility requirements, find out each of the discovered traffic cases, conduct a thorough investigation, and strictly investigate the duties. This requires the transportation management departments of the state and local governments to resolutely implement various management systems, and sign relevant responsibility letters for each regulatory department, so as to implement specific problems to specific personnel and avoid the phenomenon of so-called push and tear. . At the same time, the transportation regulatory authorities must also increase the intensity of supervision and punishment for safety testing enterprises, especially to focus on key enterprises and national enterprises. For corporate ethical standards, local government-related transportation management departments must firmly establish this standard, and at the same time increase penalties for security incidents and establish a sense of responsibility. 4.2 Strengthen the Management of Current Transportation Vehicles Manage the vehicles currently in use and follow the relevant usage methods and methods of the vehicles. This requires the relevant management personnel to continuously check and verify the hardware and other equipment of the vehicle. Since cars tend to work in more complex environments, any anomaly can lead to the event of a major accident. This requires the transportation company to set up a professional safety inspection team according to its own business characteristics and the actual needs of the customers, so as to ensure that all vehicles can be carefully inspected, so that possible safety hazards can be discovered as early as possible, thus enabling The driver can safely get on the road. When long-distance vehicles are running, it is necessary to continuously check the transportation tasks of the vehicles. Once an unexpected situation occurs, the vehicles can be repaired in time. Finally, companies must establish a complete library of automotive management files. In the archive database, information such as the age of the vehicle, maintenance and accidents should be recorded in real time to ensure that the safety inspection management personnel can rely on this information to conduct a thorough safety inspection of the vehicle. 4.3 Focus on Personnel Training In order to better carry out the safety management of automobiles, focusing on personnel training is often a key point. Relevant departments need to pay special attention to and strengthen the safety management publicity work, provide all managers with a degree of emphasis on safety management; strengthen the systematic training of safety managers, give full play to the role of role models, and promote the importance of technicians to the safety management of automobiles. To enhance the overall quality and ability of all technicians. 4.4 Control the Use of Vehicles Companies need to strictly control the use of vehicles to ensure the safety of transportation and to develop a series of specifications for the use of vehicles. Before the transportation vehicle starts, it needs to be tested to eliminate the corresponding safety hazards in time. The maintenance, maintenance and assessment ":0}
