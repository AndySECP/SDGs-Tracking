{"  (see jects Plus implementation) to comprehensive guides on doing research in that area (see Portland State ).   Librarians are also able to create subject portal pages that essentially function as mini-library websites for specific populations. Norwich University uses Drupal to create landing pages for each of their distance learning programs, which act as one-stop shops for library information for students in each discipline.   Support an Instruction Session Since most technologies for creating research guides make it almost as easy to create a course guide as it is to create a paper handout, many librarians have been creating guides to supplement their synchronous library instruction. A course guide often can contain more information than a librarian can cover in a 50-minute one-shot, and provides the student with something they can refer back to as they work on their research. Course guides can also be created for classes where the librarian does not provide instruction to point students to assignment-specific resources.  Tutorials Guide software can also be used to create tutorials as well as subject and course guides. Tutorials can range from comprehensive modular research tutorials to ones focused on a specific topic or database. In addition to timely course-specific instruction, the Business Blog at Ohio University contains tutorials on topics like company research. Similarly,  was built within the LibGuides shell. Many research guide technologies allow librarians to embed PowerPoint files, images, and videos, making them useful even for multimedia tutorials. With more modular tools like Library \u00e0 la Carte and LibGuides, smaller page or box-sized tutorials can be reused in multiple subject and course guides.  Embedded in Courseware Some librarians have worked with their technology staff to integrate their research guides into the cases, this is accomplished by creating a library widget that lives in all online courses but dynamically pulls in the relevant course or subject guide(s) to support that specific class. This makes guide content much more visible to students and faculty.  Point of Need Instruction The biggest problem with research guides is that they are rarely readily visible to patrons at their points of need. Some libraries are creating posters with QR codes and/or shortened URLs that take patrons to specific guides. These posters are being placed in locations where students are either working on subject-specific research  such as graduate student lounges  or where they frequently encounter difficulties. At Syracuse University a poster in the map room links students  map research guide. point of need can be extended to the digital world with links to research guides placed strategically in the library website and in databases that allow library content to be embedded.  Potential Value As the number of online resources libraries provide continues to grow, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the novice user to determine which sources are most useful for research on their topic. This makes research guides a critical tool in the effort to simplify the research process for students.   Many libraries that developed online research guides in the early years of the web created static HTML pages that most librarians could not edit. The task of updating guides frequently fell to webmasters, sometimes resulting in out-of-date instructional content staying up on the website. easy for librarians at every level of tech-savvy to build and quickly update guides. The ease of use has encouraged librarians to create guides not only for individual subjects, but also to support individual courses.  Online research guides have many advantages over paper handouts. Librarians are not as limited in how much information can be provided (though brevity is still important) and instead of just mentioning a specific resource, the librarian can link directly to it. Also, unlike a handout which students can easily lose, the research guide is a permanent source of help on the web and can be accessed anywhere patrons have Internet access.  ":0}
