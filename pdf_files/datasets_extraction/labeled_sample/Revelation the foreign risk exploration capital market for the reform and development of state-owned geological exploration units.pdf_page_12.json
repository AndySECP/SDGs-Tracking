{"11Business risks facing mining and metals 2014\u01522015What does broad transformation mean?New ways of thinking need to be considered to analyze and assess the level of improvements the industry needs. This involves having one view of the world:\u0141 A clear strategy based on a broad set of value drivers\u0141 An operating model that is aligned with the strategy\u0141 Integration and alignment across the value chain through process integration\u0141 Standardization of work procedures\u0141 Aligned planning, budgeting and performance measurementReal and sustainable productivity gains require a holistic, top down approach that aligns productivity activities to their strategic value and contribution, and they need to be planned and executed in a coordinated way across the value chain. It is critical that all the systems, processes, interfaces and interlinks are well understood so informed decisions can be made. There is a need for a focus on longer-term initiatives, which, while harder to execute, will have more impact on improving overall productivity as shown below:The most successful companies in addressing the productivity challenge have the following traits:\u0141 Are bold and not incremental\u0141 Have a long-term vision and plan\u0141 Take an end-to-end view\u0141 Look for broad solutions\u0141 Eliminate silos\u0141 Align objectives to strategy\u0141 Set consistent performance measures for productivity that create value\u0141 Address the behavioral and cultural settings necessary for sustainability\u0141 Learn from history, but be open to innovation\u0141 Are deliberate in planning and executing their initiativesWe believe that to really address the productivity issue requires a whole of business or end-to-end focus. This will drive a multifunctional response to problems, break down silos and ultimately deliver unprecedented productivity improvements. It\u2122s about the systems and processes, it\u2122s taking a holistic view of the different parts and how they \u00de t together. This isn\u2122t as easy as it sounds. Typically, the information and data needed to bring about this understanding is spread across the organization and differs greatly in terms of:\u0141 Volume \u0160 how much data\u0141 Variety \u0160 the type of data\u0141 Veracity \u0160 how much it can be believed\u0141 Velocity \u0160 how quickly it is generatedMany organizations are struggling with each of these measures, and in particular lack the means to cope with the sheer scale of data \u00df owing into the business and with the diverse nature of structured and unstructured data. Considerations\u0141 Are you improving or transforming?\u0141 Are your initiatives adding to thelong-term bottom line or just moving the problem?\u0141 Are you thinking about the problem conventionally or with a value chain view? \u0141 If you are considering achieving higher productivity with lower input, do not forget to consider the impact on cash \u00df ow and pro\u00de t.
