{" 71exceeded, if only the delta rho algorithm or only the delta theta algorithm has detected a fault, the system will not suspend its operation as it would for detection with either of the other algorithms or for detection with multiple algorithms. This is done since these two algorithms (the delta rho algorithm in particular) are sensitive to noise, and the fault detection should not be suspended based solely on algorithms which could be prone to having this sort of problem. However, if one of these algorithms detects a fault but the waiting time is exceeded, this fault timing information is stored separately from the other fault detection timing information in case it is later determined that a fault actually occurred. This information is processed at the end of the available time information for the present implementation of the algorithm; in practice, the analysis would be performed as faults are detected since there is no end of data in a real-life situation. The algorithm then pauses for a short period of time (which is provided by the user) to allow the breaker to clear the transmission line. This is to prevent faults from being erroneously detected immediately after resuming analysis. After this waiting time has passed, the system again initializes the variables for its operation (minimum and maximum rho values, etc.), removes the fault-indicating flags, and re-enters the time loop to wait for another fault.  It is essential to consider that, depending on the time delay between the fault detection and resumed operation of the detector, the transmission line may not yet be re-energized when the detector resumes operation. Since the minimum and maximum rho will be determined based on this system, the transmission line being re-energized may also indicate a fault. In practice, however, this fault locator device would likely be ":0}
