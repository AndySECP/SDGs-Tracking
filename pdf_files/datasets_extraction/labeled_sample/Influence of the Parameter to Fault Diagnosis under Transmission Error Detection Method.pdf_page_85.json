{" 75The fault simulations were conducted using ATPDraw, a free electric power system analysis program; the resulting data was exported into Microsoft Excel using TOP, an output processor for power system analysis programs. The Excel-format data was then processed by MATLAB using the code in Appendix C. In an actual power system setting, only the actual analysis step (here represented by the MATLAB analysis) would be performed, thus simplifying the process significantly. The results of these analyses are shown below in Figure 5-1 and Figure 5-2. The fault location error is specified in [3]. It is equal to   100%lddErroractualread  (69)where dread is the fault location detected by the algorithm, dactual is the actual location of the fault, and l is the total length of the transmission line. If a fault was detected with only one of the algorithms, this detection was not discounted. It is clear from a comparison between the accuracies of the fault detections for zero-crossing current faults and the fault detections for peak current faults that the fault location is much more reliable for faults at the peak of the current. In fact, the curve in Figure 5-1 (which is the best-case situation for fault location) is independent of fault resistance until the fault resistance becomes larger than 10 per unit (1322.5) which is the resistance for which this Figure is plotted. The faults at the currents zero-crossing were not detected at one end of the transmission line (thus preventing fault location) for fault resistances greater than 1 per unit, which is 132.25. (Note that the algorithm did detect and locate the faults at 10% and 20% of the transmission line length at this impedance, but the accuracy was incredibly poor and thus the points do not appear in Figure 5-2.) For the sake of comparison, ground fault resistances may be as high as 800 ":0}
