Manufacturer\u00d5s Creep Data.2A similarly formatted graph of the data generated in testing at GSFC is found as Figure5, and a normalized graph as Figure 6.Days Figure 5. Vectran Relaxation at NASA GSFC.When the results from Figure 5 are normalized,both for time and load, the results can be better examined. This is depicted in Figure 6, whereeach re-tensioning has also been reset to t=1.The resulting creep constants are reported inTable 6 and compared with the summary ofresults from previous Kevlar stress relaxationtesting. Table 7 shows an additional comparisontest of Kevlar and Vectran relaxation.   Normalized Time (days)Figure 6. Normalized Vectran Relaxation at NASA GSFC.Table 6.
