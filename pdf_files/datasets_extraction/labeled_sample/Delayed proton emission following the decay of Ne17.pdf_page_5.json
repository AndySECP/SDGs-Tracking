{"vi ACKNOWLEOGEMENTS The author wishes to acknowledge with gratitude the encouragement and help of Prof. R. E. Bell which was given throughout the course of this research. Prof. Bell's many tributions are reflected in the results. This thesis concerns work initiated bJ the joint diseovery of delayed proton emission hf Dr. R. Barton and the author. To Dr. Barton goes the credit for assembling the apparatus used in the initial observations. Since the PhD thesis of R. Barton involves collaborative researeh, there is some overlap in the results reported. Wbere differences occur in data and interpretation, they are due generally to later work, much of it performed with tbe collaboration of J. C. HardY. Tbe author is indebted to K. s. Kuchela who built the analyser routing logic which aided in taking results. The help of the technical staff is also much appreciated, especially that of Mr. s. Doig, foreman of the machine shop at the Fbster Radiation Laboratory. The author was assisted financially bf a National Research Council studentship held during the course of this work. ":0}
