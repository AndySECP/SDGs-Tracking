{" 85Appendix A : Model for Testing  The algorithm was tested for a 115kV transmission line using the power system simulation program ATPDraw as described in Section 5. The circuit for a ground fault simulation is shown below in Figure A-1; the data for the transmission line is shown in Figure A-2 and Figure A-3, and a diagram of the distances between the conductors and sensors is shown in Figure A-4.
