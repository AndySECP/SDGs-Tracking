While Glaser's monograph on evaluation focused on the design, conduct, and use of impact studies for improving or eliminating programs in the crime and delinquency field, the current monograph considers the various planning processes needed to reach those goals. In his most recent effort, Dr. Glaser develops a number of L.\"Uportant topics. These include the planning process in our modern, highly complex society; the importance of valid information, and the organization of that information within a conceptual-policy oriented framework; the utilization of available data and research findings; and the generation of additional data when needed. These considerations, along with several theoretical orientations to crime, are developed by Dr. Glaser to make specific suggestions about improving planning as a process in the juvenile and criminal justice systems. Moreover, he develops a set of planning propositions and outlines specific programs to provide guidance to planners and policymakers. As in Routinizing Evaluation, we provided the author complete freedom to develop the various issues on the topic of planning. No detailed specifications or outline were set in advance and no substantive changes have been made by the National Institute of Mental Health. The views expressed are those of the author. SALEEM A.
