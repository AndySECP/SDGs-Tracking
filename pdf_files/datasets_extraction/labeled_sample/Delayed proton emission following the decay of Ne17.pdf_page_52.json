{"33 half-life. Consequently the value 103! 7 msec was adopted for tbe ha1f-life of Ne17\u0141 Tbe assigned possible error does not include the remote possibility that some upward adJustment may be necessary to allow for di !fusion from Li F. The center-of-mass energies (4.10 \u00b1 0.051 4.92 + 0.05 and 5.42 + 0.05) shown in Figure 7 for protons following Ne17decay are also shown in Table 3. The proton separation energy of rl7 is 0.596 Mev. Adding this value to tbe obser-ved proton energies predicts levels in Fl7 at the energies shown in tbe second column wbich are to be compared with known levels sbown in tbe tbird column. Tbe level information for F17 is based on tbe work of Salisbury and Richards (1962) and it is seen tbat tbe predicted levels agree witbin experimental error. Figure 9 shows tbe proposed decay scbeme of Ne17 on tbe rigbt; on tbe left, for comparison is sbown a decay scbeme of its mirror nuclide N17\u0141 Tbe data for tbe delayed neutron emitter N17 is taken from a paper by Silbert and Hopkins (1964). Tbe ground state spin and parity of Nel7 sbould be I/2-by analogy with N17\u0141 Tbe spins and parities of the tbree obser-ved proton emitting leve1s at 6.04, 5.52 and 4.69 Mev indicate tbat they sbould be exeited by allowed beta transitions from Nel7\u0141 Using 14.4 Mev for tbe estimated of Ne17, and ing tbat no otber beta deeays occur, tbe experimental log ft values for tbe beta deeays to tbe tbree leve1s are 4.3, 3.7 abd 4.5 respeetively.
