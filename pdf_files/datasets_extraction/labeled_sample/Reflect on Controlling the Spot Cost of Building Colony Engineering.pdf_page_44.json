{"MULTIFAMILY GREEN BUILDING GUIDELINESPAGE37MEASURE AA7PASSIVE SOLAR DESIGN, DAYLIGHTING AND NATURAL VENTILATION\u00bb Use photocontrols for nonessential electric lighting.In common areas, photocontrols help ensure energy savings by keeping electric lights off or dimmed when there is adequate daylight.\u00bb Integrate electric lighting design with daylighting. As part of an integrated design approach, consider the electric lighting design in conjunction with daylighting to avoid unnecessary electrical con\ufb01gurations. \u00bbConsider visible transmittance (VT) when selecting windows. VT is the amount of light passing through the glass; higher VT values allow in more light. Fordaylighting fenestration in both new construction and retro\ufb01t projects, maximize VT while also choosing the U-factor and SHGC that are suitable for the climate and the fenestration\u2019s orientation (Structure: D8\u2013Window Replacement).NATURAL VENTILATIONMaking natural ventilation work well requires careful adherence to building science principles and close integration with the entire design team. Here are some general strategies: \u00bb Analyze site conditions. Before determining building placement and orientation, check local weather station data for wind speeds and direction. Consider setting up an onsite monitoring system if winds seem particularly strong. \u00bb Site building to take advantage of prevailing winds.Try to site the building so that obstacles such as other structures do not block summer winds and to take advantage of prevailing winds and pressure differences. Also, buildings and landscaping can be designed and oriented to help de\ufb02ect cold winter winds. \u00bb Design for cross ventilation. Design windows to catch prevailing breezes. Ideally, each room would have an operable window on at least two walls to enhance cross ventilation. For suf\ufb01cient air\ufb02ow, there needs to be a pressure difference between the inlet and outlet openings. Certain window styles, such as casement windows, are more suited to cross ventilation because they have a larger opening area than windows such as sliders.\u00bb Design for stack ventilation. High operable windows, skylights or cupolas combined with low operable windows can create a stack effect. Rising hot air exhausts at the higher openings, drawing in cooler air through the lower openings. \u00bbConsider air \ufb02ow within the unit. Openings between rooms, such as transom windows, grilles or open \ufb02oor plans, facilitate air \ufb02ow through the unit. If possible, design double-aspect units that provide ventilation and daylight from at least two sides.\u00bb Take into account security and noise concerns.Window openings should be operable yet secure so people feel safe leaving windows open when at home. Some window manufacturers include small operable vents in the window frames to provide fresh outdoor air without having to open the window. During design, identify neighboring sources of noise and dust and attempt to reduce those effects through the building\u2019s placement, design and landscaping.\u00bbCool the incoming air. Consider planting shade trees on the building\u2019s windward side to lower the air temperature of in\ufb02owing air. A body of water on the building\u2019s windward side can also cool the in\ufb02owing air through evaporative cooling. \u00bb Integrate natural ventilation with passive solar design and daylighting.Natural ventilation can be used at night to dissipate heat stored in thermal mass and cool the building. Look for opportunities to have openings serve multiple purposes\u2014ventilation, daylighting, views, passive solar design\u2014but carefully evaluate con\ufb02icting priorities.\u00bbConsider ceiling fans. If natural ventilation on its own will not provide adequate comfort on most days, consider supplementing it with ceiling fans (Systems: H3\u2013Advanced Ventilation Practices). Housing for senior citizens and others who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of prolonged heat may need to be equipped with some mechanical cooling to ensure safety during heat waves.Code ConsiderationsCalifornia\u2019s Building Energy Ef\ufb01ciency Standards (Title 24) is limited in its ability to account for passive solar heating. Code requires that all buildings have some form of mechanical heating. A credit is available for thermal mass; consult a Title 24 expert for information. In low-rise residential buildings, natural ventilation alone is not adequate to meet the requirements of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.2 as required by Title 24\u20132008. Mechanical ventilation in the form of a continually operating or demand-controlled exhaust or supply fan is required.For high-rise residential buildings, the design must ensure that suf\ufb01cient fresh air is supplied, but natural ventilation may be all that is required.
