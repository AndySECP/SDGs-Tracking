{"          1.1.2.1 Agricultural Residues We estimated how much crop residue could potentially be produced, and of that, how much could be removed or harvested to determine the total amount that will be available to produce ethanol in 2022. The amount of residue that can be harvested is limited by how much residue must be left on the field to maintain soil health and by the mechanical efficiency (inefficiency) of the harvesting operation.  We discuss harvesting limitations due to maintaining soil health below, while mechanical efficiencies, storage, and transport issues are discussed in section 1.3 of this DRIA. Feedstock costs are discussed in Chapter 4 of the DRIA.    Corn (Zea mays L.) and wheat are receiving the most attention across the industry due to their concentrated production areas and because between them they generate about the majority of total residue that\u2122s produced. This also means they will more likely be able to support commercial scale production. In aggregate, the other residues provide fairly significant quantities of material, but because they are spread out, e.g., less densely planted both in the field and in a county or state, they are viewed as less likely to support commercial operations.  Later, we discuss how these other lower-quantity residue crops may supplement the larger operations.   We analyzed various reports on the availability of agricultural residues.  These are summarized in Table 1.1-5. The agricultural residue estimates in Table 1.1-5 are based on historical/recent data, and thus, could be considered conservative in comparison to the future (2022) which would typically have higher crops yields or increases in acres harvested.

We estimate that by 2022 greater than 400 million tons of corn stover could be produced. Approximately 82 million tons would be needed to produce 7.8 billion gallons of 17 ":0}
