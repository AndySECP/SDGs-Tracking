Teachresidents about the strategies used so that they don\u2019t unintentionally circumvent the design. A throw rug, for example, will reduce a mass \ufb02oor\u2019s ability to store heat. Cost and Cost EffectivenessBENEFITCOSTThe strategies in this measure may increase design time. Passive solar design may increase material costs for items such as shading devices or extra concrete or drywall for thermal mass. However, passive design strategies are probably the best way to reduce \ufb01rst costs associated with system sizing (Systems: H0\u2013Heating Equipment) and provide ongoing savings throughout the building\u2019s life. A basic level of daylighting and natural ventilation can usually be provided for no increase over standard construction costs. Skylights, clerestories, tall windows, cupolas, deep overhangs, awnings and other nonstandard design features may increase costs. Strategies more common in of\ufb01ce buildings, such as light shelves, automatic lighting controls and specialized glazing, can signi\ufb01cantly increase costs.Resources\u00bbCalifornia\u2019s utility companies provide resources for passive systems design, including modeling tools, solar calculators and climate data.
