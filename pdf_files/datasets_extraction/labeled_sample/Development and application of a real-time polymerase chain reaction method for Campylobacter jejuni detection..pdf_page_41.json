{"  30 DISCUSSIONS Campylobacter jejuni has been recognized as a leading cause of human food-borne gastroenteritis.  Moreover, the rapid detection, accurate, and identification of the organism is critical for controlling and prevention of an outbreak.  In the current study, SYBR Green I based real time PCR assay was developed and tested for the qualitative and quantitative detection of C. jejuni.  A primer set was designed from C. jejuni-specific HipO gene (Hani and Chan, 1995) using the Invitrogen Vector NTI 10 (Carlsbad, CA). The target DNA sequence specificity was tested by homology search using BLAST with the nucleic acid database (NCBI BLAST service).  The results indicated that all HipO-positive sequences were C. jejuni isolates, and non-C. jejuni organisms were absent of this gene.  Thus, it demonstrated the high specificity of the current primers and the PCR amplicons. During the preliminary experiments, the PCR products were further examined by agarose gel electrophoresis to verify PCR products and optimize the PCR conditions.  Seventeen Campylobacter isolates and a pure C. jejuni genomic DNA were subject to the newly developed SYBR-Green based real-time PCR.  Immediately after each PCR run, the melting temperature profile of each isolate was determined from the melting curves of the amplified products.  The melting curves in Fig. 3.1A demonstrate a high peak for all C. jejuni -C. jejuni isolates and negative control.  Primer dimers displayed (Fig. 3.1 A and B) a low peak at .  The melting temperature profiles enhanced the specificity of the real-time PCR assay. ":0}
