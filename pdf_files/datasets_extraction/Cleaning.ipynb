Mortality kinetics andfinal CPM was greater in LQ fish than in QN fish.The LD50values calculated by both methods showedthe same pattern of the lower RM point estimatefalling within the 95% CI of the GLM method(Fig.3A). The GLM LD50values were higher in largefish than small fish for both the LQ and QN popula-tions, but this was only significant for the LQ popula-tion (Fig. 3A; log scale obscures the difference in val-ues for QN where small fish LD50was 9.5 × 104(2.4 ×104to 3.7 × 105) PFU mland large fish LD50was 1.0× 105(3.6 × 104to 3.0 × 105) PFU ml). This indicatesthat significantly more Qts07 virus was necessary tocause mortality in older fish only in the more suscep-tible LQ population. Survival analysis indicated thatfish age was a significant covariate of the risk ofdeath in LQ fish only (p<0.01).Additional steelhead trout  populations vary insusceptibility to IHNV MD Qts07To determine if steelhead trout populations from re-gions with naïve, newly emerged, or endemic IHNVhistories differ in susceptibility to the mG110M typeQts07 strain, LD50experiments were performed againwith the LQ and QN as well as 3 additional steelheadtrout populations (Table 3) in 2010 in fish that were3mo old. The EW and EC populations are from thesame site in the Puget Sound where neither M nor Ugroup IHNV has ever been de tected; both derive fromthe native wild steelhead trout of the Elwha River.The SK population comes from the Columbia RiverBasin, where IHNV has been en demic for over 30 yr,and where the mG110M has been detected manytimes in small fish since 2002. Mortality in all 5 ex -periments followed a dose-response pattern, andmortality in the mock exposed control groups was nomore than 1%tality wasslightly higher overall in both LQ and QN in 2010compared to 2009, but the results were consistent inthat a clear dose response was observed, and mortal-ity was again faster, and to higher final levels, in theLQ fish. Among the other 3 fish populations, onset ofmortality occurred on Day 3 in both EW and EC fish,and on Day 8 in SK fish. Mortality kinetics was fastestin EW fish, and slower in EC fish despite reachingonly slightly lower levels of final CPM. The SK fishhad the lowest and slowest mortality. A randomly selected subset of dead fish was tested for virus: allmortalities from virus-exposed groups had detectablevirus (ranging from 2.4 × 103to 8.5 × 106PFU g), andno mock-exposed mortalities had de tectable virus.LD50values were calculated by both GLM and RMmethods where possible; in LQ fish no dose yieldedless than 50% mortality, and in SK fish no doseyielded above 50% mortality (Fig. 3B). For the other3 steelhead trout populations the RM method pro-duced LD50values that were lower than the GLMpoint-estimates, but all were within the 95% CI of theGLM estimates. The wild native steelhead trout EWpopulation was significantly more susceptible thanthe hatchery-adapted EC population, which is rearedat the same location (p = 0.04).
