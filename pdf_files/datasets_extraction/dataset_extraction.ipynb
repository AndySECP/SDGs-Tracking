This proverbial distinction between weather and climate has served for a long time in public and media discourse as a starting point for scientists to distinguish day-to-day weather variability against the long-term forced response of climate change. The ‚weather versus climate paradigm™ is therefore typically invoked to explain phenom-ena that may be perceived as contradictory, such as cold winter days in a warming climate.

It is therefore well established that, locally or regionally, irreduc-ible uncertainties related to internal climate variability might mask forced climate changes in temperature or hydro-meteorological variables even for decades to come5,6.Detection and attribution (D&A) studies aim to identify exter-nally forced signals in the observed climate record7 such as in surface air temperature4, humidity11,12 or the seasonal cycle of tem-perature13. The confidence in the detection of a key climate change metric, that is the 40-yr trend in annual mean tropospheric tem-perature, is very high and has exceeded a 5˜ detection threshold recently14. Nonetheless, it is often argued that long-term trends are needed to detect a signal. Here we test whether externally forced climate change can be detected on shorter timescales, or even an arbitrary day in the observed record, if detection is based on a global spatial pattern.We start with a simple example to illustrate the difference in warming experienced locally and globally (Fig. 1). The past decade (2009Œ2018) has been on average 0.7 °C warmer than an earlier period (1951Œ1980). Locally, deseasonalized daily temperature anomalies fluctuate due to internal weather-related variability with a magnitude of up to 30 °C (Fig. 1a,c), depending on region and season. This substantial variation implies that despite an overall warmer climate, cold anomalies or even cold records can still occur and are to be expected15. However, at the global scale, weather-related variations tend to cancel out, and variations in deseasonal-ized global daily temperature anomalies are substantially reduced (Fig. 1b,d). Consequently, mean warming of about 0.7 °C corre-sponds to a change of about 2.0˜ globally, but only to around 0.25˜ locally. This difference is consistent with the occurrence of global heat records in recent years despite large variability regionally16. Overall, the example anticipates that ‚global weather™, even in the form of a naive average, carries important although not the optimal information about climate change.Formal D&A of externally forced signals in Earth™s observed climate relies on spatial patterns, so-called ‚fingerprints™, that encapsulate expected physical climate responses to external forc-ing7. We extend an established fingerprint detection method11,13,17 by incorporating a regression method that improves the separa-tion of signal and noise based on daily data (see Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1). First, we define two key climate change metrics, annual global mean temperature (AGMT) and a decadal average of Earth™s energy imbalance (EEI), that serve as target variables for detection. AGMT characterizes climate warming from a surface perspective, used in policy assessments18,19, while EEI characterizes the state of climate change from a more physi-cally motivated energy balance perspective20,21. Second, we train regularized linear regression models, using ridge regression, that predict each of the two targets from daily spatial patterns of surface temperature and/or humidity for each month and based  on model simulations in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model archive driven by external forcing. This step yields fingerprints as maps of regression coef-ficients that encapsulate the relationship between global patterns of daily weather and each target metric while reducing ‚noise™ in regions with large internal variability or model disagreement. Finally, and similarly to established detection methods11,13,17, we project observations onto the model-derived fingerprints to obtain a prediction of each target metric. We then assess whether externally forced climate change is detected by testing against the null hypothesis that the predicted test statistic is indistinguishable from natural variability.Overall, we estimate AGMT from any given day with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.09 °C (Pearson correlation ˚ 0.99) across Climate change now detectable from any single day of weather at global scaleSebastian Sippel˜˜1,2,3*, Nicolai Meinshausen2, Erich M.

       " ' However, weather when considered globally is now in uncharted terri-tory',\n",
       " ' Here we show that on the basis of a single day of globally observed temperature and moisture, we detect the fingerprint of externally driven climate change, and conclude that Earth as a whole is warming',\n",
       " ' Our detection approach invokes statisti-cal learning and climate model simulations to encapsulate the relationship between spatial patterns of daily temperature and humidity, and key climate change metrics such as annual global mean temperature or Earth™s energy imbalance',\n",
       " ' Observations are projected onto this relationship to detect climate change',\n",
       " ' The fingerprint of climate change is detected from any single day in the observed global record since early 2012, and since 1999 on the basis of a year of data',\n",
       " ' Detection is robust even when ignoring the long-term global warming trend',\n",
       " ' This complements traditional climate change detection, but also opens broader perspectives for the communication of regional weather events, modifying the climate change narrative: while changes in weather locally are emerging over decades, global climate change is now detected instantaneously',\n",
       " 'ﬁClimate is what you expect, weather is what you getﬂ8',\n",
       " ' This proverbial distinction between weather and climate has served for a long time in public and media discourse as a starting point for scientists to distinguish day-to-day weather variability against the long-term forced response of climate change',\n",
       " ' The ‚weather versus climate paradigm™ is therefore typically invoked to explain phenom-ena that may be perceived as contradictory, such as cold winter days in a warming climate',\n",
       " ' However, Earth™s climate is in fact variable on a broad spectrum of timescales9',\n",
       " ' Variability on weather timescales integrates to produce internal variability on ‚climate™ timescales10',\n",
       " ' It is therefore well established that, locally or regionally, irreduc-ible uncertainties related to internal climate variability might mask forced climate changes in temperature or hydro-meteorological variables even for decades to come5,6',\n",
       " 'Detection and attribution (D&A) studies aim to identify exter-nally forced signals in the observed climate record7 such as in surface air temperature4, humidity11,12 or the seasonal cycle of tem-perature13',\n",
       " ' The confidence in the detection of a key climate change metric, that is the 40-yr trend in annual mean tropospheric tem-perature, is very high and has exceeded a 5˜ detection threshold recently14',\n",
       " ' Nonetheless, it is often argued that long-term trends are needed to detect a signal',\n",
       " ' Here we test whether externally forced climate change can be detected on shorter timescales, or even an arbitrary day in the observed record, if detection is based on a global spatial pattern',\n",

       " ' This substantial variation implies that despite an overall warmer climate, cold anomalies or even cold records can still occur and are to be expected15',\n",

       " ' This difference is consistent with the occurrence of global heat records in recent years despite large variability regionally16',\n",
       " ' Overall, the example anticipates that ‚global weather™, even in the form of a naive average, carries important although not the optimal information about climate change',\n",
       " 'Formal D&A of externally forced signals in Earth™s observed climate relies on spatial patterns, so-called ‚fingerprints™, that encapsulate expected physical climate responses to external forc-ing7',\n",
       " ' We extend an established fingerprint detection method11,13,17 by incorporating a regression method that improves the separa-tion of signal and noise based on daily data (see Methods and Extended Data Fig',\n",

       " ' First, we define two key climate change metrics, annual global mean temperature (AGMT) and a decadal average of Earth™s energy imbalance (EEI), that serve as target variables for detection',\n",
       " ' AGMT characterizes climate warming from a surface perspective, used in policy assessments18,19, while EEI characterizes the state of climate change from a more physi-cally motivated energy balance perspective20,21',\n",
       " ' Second, we train regularized linear regression models, using ridge regression, that predict each of the two targets from daily spatial patterns of surface temperature and/or humidity for each month and based  on model simulations in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model archive driven by external forcing',\n",
       " ' This step yields fingerprints as maps of regression coef-ficients that encapsulate the relationship between global patterns of daily weather and each target metric while reducing ‚noise™ in regions with large internal variability or model disagreement',\n",
       " ' Finally, and similarly to established detection methods11,13,17, we project observations onto the model-derived fingerprints to obtain a prediction of each target metric',\n",
       " ' We then assess whether externally forced climate change is detected by testing against the null hypothesis that the predicted test statistic is indistinguishable from natural variability',\n",
