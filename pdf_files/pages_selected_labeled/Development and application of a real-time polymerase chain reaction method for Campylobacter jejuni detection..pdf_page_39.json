{"  28 DNA ladder (Promega, Madison, WI) was used.  Gels were stained in ethidium bromide for about 20 min and visualized using a Gel-Doc UV ultra illuminator.  RESULTS  Primer testing After selection, primers were checked for melting temperature, primer length (at least 18 to ensure sufficient hybridization to the target), and lack of repeat bases, especially G and C and G+ C content of the target sequences.  The specificity of the target sequences and probe were also subject to a BLAST check (http://.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLSAT).  Non-Campylobacter bacteria or non-jejuni Campylobacter spp. did not have sequence similarities in the BLSTN databases.    Specificity testing  One commercially purchased pure C. jejuni genomic DNA standard, eight isolates of C. jejuni, eight isolates of C. coli and one isolate of C. lari were tested with the C. jejuni specific primers and the melting peak temperatures were also determined for the amplicons.  As shown in Figure 3.1A and 3.2A, all C. jejuni isolates displayed a which was due to the unspecific binding of SYBR-Green dye to the primer dimmers.  The results from the gel electrophoresis confirmed that all the isolates of C. jejuni displayed to targeted bands (Fig. 3.1B), while the other strains did not yield any band (Fig. 3.2B). ":0}
