{"  29 Sensitivity using pure bacteria culture After growth for 24 h, bacteria were suspended in PBS buffer with an optical density value of 0.4 at wavelength of 600nm.  One ml of the bacterial culture suspension was used to extract genomic DNA, and 10-fold dilutions of the DNA templates were examined by the current method.  The results showed a linear logarithmic correlative curve over the dilution series (Fig 3.4A and Fig 3.4)  Quantitative analysis for SYBR Green I real time PCR   In quantitative analysis, serial dilutions were made for C. jejuni from pure culture.  The starting concentration in colony forming unit (CFU) was determined using the spread plate methods.  Two l of the each dilution was subjected to the real-time PCR reaction.  The standard curve of each serial dilution was constructed by regression analysis plotting log CFU against crossing threshold (Ct).  The data were subsequently analyzed by the Minitab, by which regression equations were generated (Fig. 3.3B; Fig. 3.4B and Fig. 3.5B).  For example, in the first run, the regression equation was Ct= 34.17-3.527 log CFU.  A square regression coefficient of 0.999 indicated highly significant linear relationship between Ct value and log CFU.  Therefore, with the regression equations, one can estimate bacteria concentration in the sample using the Ct value.  As shown in the Figure 3.3B, 3.4B and 3.5B, all regression relationships were significant, and they all have similar slopes.  Based on the standard curves, the detection limit of the SYBR Green I based real-time PCR from pure culture was calculated to be approximately less than 10 CFU/ml.  ":0}
