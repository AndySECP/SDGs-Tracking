{" 4intensity. The two-dimensional magnetic field intensity can then be resolved from this information.  Just as with many other fault detection methods, faults are detected when unexpected changes occur within the monitored data. The only difference is that this analysis attempts to detect changes in the vertical and horizontal magnetic field intensities rather than individual changes in the monitored voltages or conductor currents. The fault detection and location method discussed in this thesis is based on analysis of the expected behavior of the magnetic field near a transmission line and algorithms for detecting unexpected variations.
