{" 816. Conclusions  This thesis described the theory and methods of traveling wave fault detection and location using magnetic field sensing coils. The concept of the magnetic field for a general and three phase system was explored. This was followed by a presentation of the magnetic fields for a variety of conductor configurations and sensor locations. The four algorithms used in the magnetic field-based fault detection were then described. Finally, the combined algorithm was explained, and the results of accuracy and maximum detectable fault resistance were presented. The magnetic field sensors were shown to be effective in detecting faults conceptually. Additionally, the collective algorithm was tested and was shown to provide accurate fault detection for relatively high fault impedances and for each common type of fault. All of this proves the magnetic field sensor to be a viable tool for power transmission line fault detection. Future research could be performed in applying these algorithms to more complete systems than the single transmission line which was used for analysis in this thesis. Additionally, other fault location algorithms  most specifically, a fault location and classification scheme using the wavelet transform  could be modified to make use of the magnetic field. This will most likely improve the accuracy of fault location and increase the maximum detectable fault impedances. Eventually a prototype of the magnetic field-based fault detector could be built and field tested. This would require more development of the sensor coils as well as harmonic-filtering circuitry. The MATLAB code would also need to be reconfigured since it is currently written to analyze pre-prepared sets of data to test the algorithm ":0}
