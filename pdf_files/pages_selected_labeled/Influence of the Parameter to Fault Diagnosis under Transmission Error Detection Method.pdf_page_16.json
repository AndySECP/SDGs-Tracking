{" 6line  is that the fault impedance must be near-zero for the result to be accurate, since the fault impedance affects the impedance seen at the end of the transmission line [3]. This problem has been mitigated in several different ways. One of the best-known of these ways is the Takagi method. This changes the calculation to include the difference between the current measured before the fault and the current measured after the fault (which is the fault current) [1]. This eliminates the fault impedance from the analysis, thus removing this significant source of error. However, the angle of the fault current and the angle of the current during the fault at the relay terminals are assumed to be equal; if this is not true, there may be errors in the fault location. Two-terminal impedance-based fault location methods, or those that use measurements from both ends of the transmission line, can also significantly improve the accuracy of the fault location estimate [4]. Two-terminal methods require communication between the locators at both ends of the transmission line to transfer information about the currents, voltages, and source impedances in order to perform the fault location. Once all of the necessary information is gathered in one location, the fault is located by combining the equations describing both sides of the transmission line and variables directly related to the fault; the exact analysis depends on the particular algorithm [2,3]. The use of both sides of the transmission line in calculation removes most of the problems associated with one-terminal impedance-based fault location methods. It is essential to note, however, that short-duration faults are difficult to accurately detect with any impedance-based fault location methods (although two-terminal methods reduce the effect of short fault durations) since less data is available about the voltages and currents and the data that is available is not necessarily in steady-state [4].
