{" 44multiple of this maximum. Finally, the fourth algorithm detects the maximum and minimum changes in theta every half cycle and determines if the change in theta between the last two data points is significantly higher than the calculated maximum or significantly lower than the calculated minimum. 4.1.1. The Expected Ellipse Algorithm  Since the magnetic field will typically form an ellipse in steady state, the simplest way for a microprocessor to determine if there is a fault is to sense if the magnetic field intensities significantly change from the elliptical pattern. There are several ways to perform such an analysis. One is to approximate the shape of the ellipse and determine, once a mostly constant ellipse has been found, if and when the instantaneous magnetic field value deviates from that ellipse. Such a deviation from a constant ellipse is shown below in Figure 4-1.   20  40  603021060240902701203001503301800 Figure 4-1  Constant ellipse with a sudden change due to a fault  ":0}
