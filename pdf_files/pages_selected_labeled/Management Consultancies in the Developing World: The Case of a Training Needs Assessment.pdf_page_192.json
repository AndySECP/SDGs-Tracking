"Chapter Seven: Research Contributions, Conclusions & Recommendations 2014  - 180 -  7.5 Limitations of the Study Every research project is limited by some constraints of the researcher, and this study is no exception. These are the limitations of this study.   Generalization:  The sample study has been restricted to the ADP in the UAE, so the generalisation of the findings of the present study is limited to the military organisations and other security companies operating in the UAE. The generalisation to other business sectors in the UAE is not possible due to the different organisational environment and context, and to different social, economical and political issues.  Quality of the Data:  Samples of the study were comprised of individuals involved with TNA functions in the ADP. The respondents were asked to answer the questions d practices on TNA and this emphasis was also reflected in the interviews. The quality of the data obtained from such an approach might be questionable due to possible inaccuracies or exaggeration. Although all necessary precautions were taken to enhance reliability and accuracy of the data, such possibilities are not unusual in this study. The data reported in this study may thus need to be treated with some caution as it might be subject to much personal opinion or perception.  Responses of the Respondents:  At the time of interview, it was found that the respondents were not so enthusiastic. Some of the respondents were making delay to face the interview. The researcher had to spent huge time for conducting the interview.  Avoidance of Particular Questions:  It was found that the respondents showed discomfort and tried to avoid some of the particular questions relating to their performances, which may disclose their performance deficiencies, since they may have a negative impact on their position. Research found tactical answers on those questions.  "
