{"  26  Media and culture conditions Strains were recovered from the frozen storage and spread on the modified Campy-Cefex (mCC) plates (Oyarzabal et al., 2005).  Plates were subsequently incubated for 24 xygen; Airgas, Radnor, PA) using anaerobic jars for 24h.  Growth was mixed in PBS and then the suspension was adjusted to a 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard.  One ml of the suspension of each strain was used to extract DNA.  At the same time, the suspension was serially diluted in PBS, and 0.1ml from each dilution was spread-plated on mCC plates.  determined after 48 h of incubation.  DNA extraction DNA extractions were done using PrepMan Ultra Sample Preparation Reagent (Applied Biosystems, Froster City, CA) according to man  Real-time primer and probe Two oligonucleotide primers were selected from the C. jejuni HipO gene (GenBank -GGC TTC TTC GGA TAG TTA TAG CAT- -ATG TCC TGC ATT AAA AGC TCC T- generated an amplicon of 338 bp.  The primers were synthesized by Sigma Genosis (Sigma-Genosys, The woodlands, TX).  The target sequence for the SYBR Green assay was subjected to a BLAST search in nucleic acid database (NCBI BLAST service).    ":0}
