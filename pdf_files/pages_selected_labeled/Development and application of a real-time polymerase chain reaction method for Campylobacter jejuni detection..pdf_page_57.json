{"  47 Vector NTI 10 (Carlsbad, CA).  The target DNA sequence were subjected to a BLAST search in nucleic acid database (NCBI BLAST service), and there was no known non-C.  jejuni organism that has the similar sequences in the BLSTN databases.  All primers and probe were synthesized by Sigma Genosis (Sigma-Genosys, The woodlands, TX).  TaqMan Based Real-Time polymerase chain reaction The amplification reactions were conducted on Roche LightCycler System v1.5 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), and the data analyses were performed using LightCycler software version 4.05.  A total reaction volume of 20l contains following ingredient:  4l of LightCycler TaqMan Master Mix (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), 0.6l of forward primer (10M) and reverse primer (10M) (respectively), and 0.3l of probe (10M), 12.5l of PCR grade water and 2l of sample DNA  Real-time PCR conditions are set with a pre-min to activate the FastStart DNA polymerase and denature the target DNA, and followed by for extension.  Capillaries and equipment were cooled down to at the end of the PCR for 30s at (Table 4.2).  A single acquisition mode was set at the end of extension stage of amplification.  Agarose gel electrophoresis To verifying PCR result, amplicons were removed from the capillaries and examined by the standard gel electrophoresis. Stained gels were visualized using a UV ultra ":0}
