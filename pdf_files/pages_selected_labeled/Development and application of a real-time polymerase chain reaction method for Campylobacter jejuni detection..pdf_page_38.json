{"  27 SYBR Green I real time PCR assay The amplification reactions were conducted in a Roche LightCycler System v1.5, and the data analyses were performed using LightCycler software version 4.05.  All the SYBR Green I assay reactions were performed in glass capillary tubes (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN).  Each tube contains 20l of PCR reaction mixture with the ingredients as following:  2l of LightCycler FastStart MasterPLUS SYBR Green I master mixture (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), 0.8l of 10M forward primer, 0.8ul of 10um reverse primer, 2l of MgCl2, 12.4 l of PCR grade water and 2l of target DNA.  LightCycler FastStart MasterPLUS SYBR-Green I is a ready to use hot-start reaction mix for PCR on the LightCycler carousel-based system with requirement of addition of only enzyme prior to use.  The program, temperature and hold time used for the real-time PCR profile are described in Table 3.1.  A melting curve analysis was used to determining the melting temperature profile of the target DNA products generated from the amplification.  This  for the sufficient binding with target DNA by the SYBR- Agarose gel electrophoresis To verifying PCR result, amplicons were removed from the capillaries and examined by standard gel electrophoresis with a Bio-Rad gel electrophoresis machine. Gels were made with 1.5% agarose by mixing Ultra Pure DNA Grade Agarose (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) with 1xTris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer. A 100 bp ":0}
