The statistical \nspectral analysis of various complex systems requires, therefore, a thorough \nprobing of a wide range of random matrix ensembles which is not an easy task. \nIt is highly desirable, if possible,  to identify a common \nmathematical structure \namong all the ensembles and analyze it to gain information about the ensemble-\nproperties.\n% of the latter. \nOur successful search in this direction leads to Calogero \nHamiltonian,\na one-dimensional quantum \nHamiltonian with inverse-square interaction, as the common base. \nThis is because both, the  \n  eigenvalues of the ensembles, and, a general state of Calogero Hamiltonian, \n  evolve in an analogous way for arbitrary initial conditions. The varying \nnature of the complexity is reflected in  different form of the evolution   \nparameter in each case. A complete investigation of Calogero Hamiltonian \ncan then help us in the spectral analysis of complex systems. \n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{  PACS numbers: 05.45+b, 03.65 sq, 05.40+j}\n%.\n\n\tRecent statistical studies in various branches of theoretical \nphysics, ranging from Calogero model of 1-d fermionic system \\cite{cal",
