Our calculation for the $1S$ state has a numerical\nuncertainty of 0.8~Hz for hydrogen and 13~Hz for singly-ionized\nhelium. Resummation and convergence acceleration techniques that\nreduce the computer time by about three orders of magnitude were\nemployed in the calculation.  The numerical results are compared to\nresults based on known terms in the expansion of the self energy in\npowers of $Z\\alpha$.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{PACS numbers 12.20.Ds, 31.30.Jv, 06.20.Jr, 31.15.-p}\n\nRecently, there has been a dramatic increase in the accuracy of\nexperiments that measure the transition frequencies in hydrogen and\ndeuterium \\cite{BeEtAl1997,UdEtAl1997}.  This progress is due in part\nto the use of frequency chains that bridge the range between optical\nfrequencies and the microwave cesium time standard.  The most\naccurately measured transition is the $1S$-$2S$ frequency in hydrogen;\nit has been measured with a relative uncertainty of $3.4 \\times\n10^{-13}$ or $840~{\\rm Hz}$. With trapped hydrogen atoms, it should\nbe feasible to observe the $1S$-$2S$ frequency with an experimental\nlinewidth that approaches the $1.3\\,{\\rm Hz}$ natural width of the\n$2S$ level \\cite{CeEtAl1996,KiEtAl1998}.  Indeed, it is likely that\ntransitions in hydrogen will eventually be measured with an\nuncertainty below $1\\,{\\rm Hz}$ \\cite{HaPr,FrPr",
