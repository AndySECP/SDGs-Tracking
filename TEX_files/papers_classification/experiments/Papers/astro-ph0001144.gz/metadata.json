The abundance\nanalysis shows that  in   these  stars the abundances   of   s-process\nelements with respect to the metallicity  are nearly normal. Tc is not\npresent in most of  them, although upper limits  have been derived for\nWZ  Cas and WX  Cyg, perhaps  two   SC-type rather than J-type  carbon\nstars. The Rb abundances, obtained from  the resonance 7800 {\\AA} Rb I\nline, are surprisingly low, probably due  to strong non-LTE effects in\nthe  formation  of this line  in cool   carbon-rich stars.
