It is shown that the bandstructure calculations presented by\nthe authors contain several important inconsistencies, which make\ntheir main conclusions highly questionable.\n\\end{abstract} \n% \nIn a recent paper Wu et.~{\\it al.}~\\cite{wu99b} presented\nbandstructure calculations for the quasi one-dimensional CuO-chain\ncompound SrCuO$_2$ and the quasi two-dimensional material CaCuO$_2$,\nboth being of prototypical character and therefore of general\ninterest.  Wu et.~{\\it al.}~used a full-potential linear combination of atomic\norbitals method \\cite{wu99a",
