In these experiments,\nthe particle configurations start from an initially disordered,\nlow-packing-fraction state and under vertical vibrations evolve to a\ndense, highly ordered, nematic state in which the long particle axes\nalign with the vertical tube walls.  We find that the orientational\nordering process is reflected in a characteristic, steep rise in the\nlocal packing fraction.  At any given height inside the packing, the\nordering is initiated at the container walls and proceeds inward.  We\nexplore the evolution of the local as well as the height-averaged\npacking fraction as a function of vibration parameters and compare our\nresults to relaxation experiments conducted on spherically shaped\ngranular materials.\n\\end{abstract}\n \n\\pacs{45.70.-n,05.40.-a,45.70.Cc,81.05.Rm}\n\n%1999\n%45.70.-n Granular systems\n%05.40.-a Fluctuation phenomena, random processes, noise, and Brownian motion\n%45.70.Cc Static sandpiles; granular compaction\n%81.05.Rm Porous materials; granular materials\n%\n%45.70.Mg Granular flow: mixing, segregation and stratification\n%83.70.Fn Granular solids\n%81.20.Ev Powder processing; powder metallurgy, compaction, sintering,\n%mechanical alloying, and granulation\n%45.70.Qj Pattern formation\n%45.70.Vn Granular models of complex systems; traffic flow\n}\n\n\\section{Introduction"
