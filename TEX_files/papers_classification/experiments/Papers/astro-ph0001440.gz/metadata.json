This method is\nintended to remedy shortcomings of current error estimation, by\neliminating intermediate data evaluations and working directly with\nexperimental data, allowing error estimation based solely on published\nexperimental uncertainties.  This technique also allows simple\nincorporation of new data and reduction of errors with the\nintroduction of more precise data.  Application of our method\nindicates that previous error estimates on the calculated abundances\nwere too large by as much as a factor of three.  Since uncertainties\nin the BBN calculation currently dominate inferences drawn from\nlight-element abundances, the re-estimated errors have important\nconsequences for cosmic baryon density, neutrino physics, and lithium\ndepletion in halo stars.  Our direct method allows detailed discussion\nof the status of the nuclear inputs, by identifying clearly the places\nwhere improved cross section measurements would be most useful.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{26.35.+c, 98.80.Ft}\n%\\vskip 1in\n]\n\n%\\twocolumn\n\n\\section{introduction",
