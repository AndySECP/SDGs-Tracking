With the distance-scale \nenigma solved, the study of the late-time\nGRB emission is now the most promising approach \nto disclose the origin of these explosions\n     and their relationship with the environment of the host \ngalaxy in the early phase of the Universe. In this \ncontribution I will review X-ray observations and their implication on our\n     undertstanding on the GRB phenomenon. \nThese measurements are providing\na direct probe into the nature of the progenitor and\na measurement of the GRB beaming properties, crucial to \nestablish the total energy output. \nSome evidence of iron lines connects the GRB explosion with\nmassive progenitors, thence with star-forming regions.\nFurthermore a comparison of\nthe spectral  properties with the temporal evolution \nindicates that the fireball \nexpansion should not be - on average - highly collimated,\nwith a jet angle $>10 \\deg$. \n\n\\keywords{Gamma rays: bursts; X-rays: general; Cosmology: early Universe}\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\section{Introduction",
