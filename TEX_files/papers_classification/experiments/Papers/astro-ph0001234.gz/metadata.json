We believe that these binary systems are among the\nmost promising candidates for the progenitors of bipolar planetary nebulae.\n\nWe present a list of the optically extended nebulae known to date around\nsymbiotic Miras, and illustrate their properties using recent HST and ESO-NTT\n\\nii\\ images of He~2-104 and He~2-147.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nSymbiotic Miras are interacting binary systems composed of a late AGB star\nand a hot white dwarf. Even though the orbital periods of none of these\nsystems have been measured, they are thought to be of the order of 20-100 yr\n(cf. Miko{\\l",
