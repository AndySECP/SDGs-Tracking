For the wavelength of observation the\nnonlinearity is mixed absorptive/defocusing. Bright solitons\nappear more stable than dark ones.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{PACS 42.65.Sf; 42.65.Tg; 42.70.Nq} \\vskip1pc ]\n% BEGIN TEXT HERE\nThe possibility of the existence of spatial solitons in\nsemiconductor resonators has recently been investigated in some\ndetail theoretically \\cite{tag:1,tag:2} motivated, among others,\nby possible usefulness of such structures in new types of optical\ninformation processing. Bright and dark solitons have been\npredicted. The majority of the papers treated bright solitons\n\\cite{tag:1}. We have recently reported on experiments concerning\nthe switching space-time dynamics of quantum-well semiconductor\nresonators \\cite{tag:3}. In these experiments we showed the\nexistence of hexagonal patterns, some \"robustness\" of small\nswitched domains and the possibility of switching of individual\nelements of ensembles of bright spots; thus giving first evidence\nfor stable localized structures. In this letter we show directly\nthe existence of bright and dark solitons. \\\\\n\nThe semiconductor resonator used for the measurements consists of\nflat Bragg mirrors of about 99.7 $\\%$ reflectivity with 18\nGaAs/Ga$_{0.5}$Al$_{0.5}$As quantum wells between them\n\\cite{tag:4",
