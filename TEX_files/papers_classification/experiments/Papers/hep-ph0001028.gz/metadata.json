Specifically, we study how an upper cut on the invariant\nmass spectrum, which is necessary to extract $V_{ub}$, results in the\nbreakdown of the standard perturbative expansion due to the existence\nof large infrared logs.  We first show how the decay rate factorizes\nat the level of the double differential distribution. Then, we\npresent closed form expressions for the resummed cut rate for the\ninclusive decays $B\\rightarrow X_s\\,\\gamma$ and $B\\rightarrow\nX_u\\,e\\,\\nu$ at next-to-leading order in the infrared logs. Using these\nresults, we determine the range of cuts for which resummation is\nnecessary, as well as the range for which the resummed expansion\nitself breaks down. We also use our results to extract the leading and\nnext to leading infrared log contribution to the two loop differential\nrate. We find that for the phenomenologically interesting cut values, \nthere is only a small region where the calculation is\nunder control.  Furthermore, the size of this region is sensitive to\nthe parameter $\\bar{\\Lambda}$. We discuss the viability of extracting\n$V_{ub}$ from the hadronic mass spectrum.\n\\end{abstract}\n}%end tighten\n\n%%\\pacs{}\n\n\\newpage\n\n\\section{Introduction",
