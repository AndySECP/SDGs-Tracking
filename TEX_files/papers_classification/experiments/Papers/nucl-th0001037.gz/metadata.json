In this method, the analyticity of the eigenvalues \nand eigenfunctions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation with respect to the\ncoupling strength is exploited to analytically continue the bound--state\nsolutions into the positive--energy region by means of Pad\\'e approximants\nof the second kind. The method is here applied to single--particle wave\nfunctions \nof the $^{154}{\\rm Sm}$ and $^{131}{\\rm Eu}$ nuclei. A comparison of the\nresults with the direct solution of the Schr\\\"odinger equation shows that  \nthe method can be confidently applied also in coupled--channel situations\nrequiring high numerical accuracy.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{PACS numbers : 25.70.Ef, 23.50.+z, 27.60.+j}\n%\\addvspace{3mm}]\n\n\\narrowtext\n\nIn recent years there has been an increasing experimental activity\\cite{wd97",
