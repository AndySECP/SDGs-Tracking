Limitations of actual model atmospheres\nwhen fine precision is required for the calculations of partial\nderivatives and integrals, which depend on limb darkening coefficients,\nare discussed. Two methods are discussed to calculate the {\\em phase~lags},\nthe angle between maximum temperature and minimum radius, and $R$, a\nparameter which describes departure from adiabaticity of the atmospheres\nof these pulsating stars. These quantities appear to be very dependent\non the convection as parametrized by the mixing length theory.  When one\nof the methods is applied to the $\\gamma$ Dor stars gives {\\em phase~lags",
