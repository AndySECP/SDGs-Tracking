Our model, which is closely related to certain\n``bit--string'' models of evolution, incorporates competition for\nresources via a population dependent death probability, as well as a\nvariable reproduction probability for each individual as a function of\nage. We first solve for the steady--state of the model in mean field\ntheory, before developing analytic techniques to compute Gaussian\nfluctuation corrections around the mean field fixed point. Our\ncomputations are found to be in good agreement with Monte--Carlo\nsimulations. Finally we discuss how similar methods may be applied to\nfluctuations in continuous time population models.  \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{PACS numbers: 87.23.-n, 02.50.-r, 05.40.-a, 87.23.Cc}]\n\nThe problem of population dynamics has attracted enormous interest over many\nyears (for some introductions and recent applications see Refs.~\\cite\n{murray,pielou,pollard,charles,rose,penna,tol,redner",
