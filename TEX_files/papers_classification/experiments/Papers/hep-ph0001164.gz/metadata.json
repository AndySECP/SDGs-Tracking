The gluon polarization tensor of such a\nsystem is explicitly computed within the semiclassical kinetic and \nHard Loop diagrammatic theories. The equivalence of  the two \napproaches is demonstrated. The quark self energy is computed as \nwell, and finally, the dispersion relations of quarks and gluons in the \nanisotropic medium are discussed.\n\n\\end{abstract",
