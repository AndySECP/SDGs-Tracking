In this contribution, I discuss how observations with\nfuture X-ray missions will extend these studies and all us to\nobservationally address issues which are currently only in the realm of\nthe theorists.  In particular, high-throughput spectroscopy with {\\it\nXMM} and, eventually, {\\it Constellation-X} will allow the full\ndiagnostic power of iron line variability to be realized.  Instabilities\nof the inner accretion flow, the geometry of the variable X-ray source,\nand the black hole mass and spin will all be open to study.  Eventually,\nX-ray interferometry will allow direct imaging of the black hole region\nin nearby active galaxies, thereby providing the ultimate probe of black\nhole astrophysics.\n\\keywords{accretion, accretion discs -- black hole physics -- galaxies:\nactive -- X-rays: general -- line: profiles}               \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nAs we have heard in this meeting, X-ray spectroscopy with {\\it ASCA} and\n{\\it BeppoSAX",
