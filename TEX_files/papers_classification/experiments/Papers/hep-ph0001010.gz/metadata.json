By using\nquark-lepton symmetries, derived from  Grand Unification and/or string\ntheories, we show how to determine the  necessary neutrino \nparameters. In addition,  the seesaw neutrino masses   set the scale\nfor  the proton decay operators by ``measuring'' the standard model\ncut-off. The SuperKamiokande values suggest  that proton decay is\nlikely to be observed early in the XXIst Century. \n\n\n\\end{abstract",
