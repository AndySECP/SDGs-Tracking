As these clusters typically\ncontain more mass in gas than in stars, accretion\ncan play an important role in determining the final\nstellar masses. Numerical simulations of gas accretion\nin stellar clusters have found that the stars compete for the available\nreservoir of gas. \nThe accretion rates are highly nonuniform and are\ndetermined primarily by each star's position in the \ncluster.  Stars in the centre accrete more gas, \nresulting in initial mass segregation.  This \ncompetitive accretion naturally results in a mass \nspectrum and is potentially the dominant mechanism for\nproducing the initial mass function.  Furthermore,\naccretion on to the core of a cluster forces it to\nshrink, which may result in formation of massive stars through\ncollisions. \n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{Star formation, Mass segregation, Stellar masses, IMF}\n\n\\section{Introduction",
