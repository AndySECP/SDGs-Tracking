This method permits us to define the additional structure of a\nbilinear differential ``cup product'' on this sequence, satisfying a Leibniz\nrule up to curvature terms. It is not associative, but is part of an\n$A_\\infty$-algebra of multilinear differential operators, which we also obtain\nexplicitly.  We illustrate the construction in the case of conformal\ndifferential geometry, where the cup product provides a wide-reaching\ngeneralization of helicity raising and lowering for conformally invariant\nfield equations.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\maketitle\n%\n\\vspace{-4mm}\n\\section*{Introduction}\n\nIn a sequence of pioneering papers~\\cite{Baston1,Baston2,Baston3",
