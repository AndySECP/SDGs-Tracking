At large $N_c$\nthe closed system of  equations for the  gauge--invariant quark\nGreen's function in the field of static source is examined\nanalytically. The\nformation of the string connecting the light quark to the static\nsource is observed numerically. The scalar Lorentz nature of the\nresulting confinement is shown to hold for the considered\ncase, implying chiral symmetry breaking. The resulting spectrum with\nand without perturbative gluon exchanges is obtained numerically and\ncompared to the $B$ and $D$ meson masses and HQET.\n\\end{abstract}\n% insert suggested PACS numbers in braces on next line\n\\vspace {2cm}\n\n Pacs: {12.38Gc, 12.38Lg,12.39.Hg}\n\n\\newpage\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe nature of QCD string formation between static  sources was studied on the\nlattice \\cite{1,2} and analytically \\cite{2}. From these investigations it was\nshown that the string consists of a predominantly color--electric longitudinal field.\nAt the critical temperature $T_c$ this electric field disappears and\nand at the same time\nthe deconfined phase with color--magnetic condensate sets in. This\neffect was predicted theoretically in \\cite{3} and also seen in lattice\nmeasurements\\cite{4",
