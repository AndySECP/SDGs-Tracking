We calculate the joint probability of\ncomplex eigenvalues and some other correlation functions. We find that the\ntransition is abrupt and occurs as a result of an interplay between two\nsaddle-points in the free energy functional. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{72.15.Rn, 73.20.Fz, 74.60.Ge}\n\n%\\begin{multicols}{2}\n\nNon-Hermitian models with disorder have attracted recently a considerable\nattention \\cite{Nelson,weak,EfnoH,chain,lerner,Zee,all,Yurk,HyDy,QCD,QMech}. \n%One comes to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians reducing a $d+1$ dimensional classical \n%system to a $d$-dimensional quantum one \\cite{Nelson}. They also \nNon-Hermitian Hamiltonians appear in context of flux lines in superconductors\n\\cite{Nelson}, in transfer phenomena in lossy media \\cite{Yurk}, in hydrodynamics\n\\cite{HyDy}, in QCD \\cite{QCD}, in quantum mechanics of open systems \\cite{QMech}.\n\nThe most important property of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is that their\neigenenergies can be complex independently of their origin.\n%type of the non-Hermiticity.\nVery interesting physical systems are models with a direction. The simplest \nHamiltonian ${\\cal H}$ of such models is written as \n\\begin{equation}\n{\\cal H}=\\frac{({\\bf p}+i{\\bf h",
