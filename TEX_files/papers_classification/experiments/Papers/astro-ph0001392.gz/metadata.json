None of our \nnine targetted metal-poor primaries have companions more massive than\nthe hydrogen burning limit, implying that the halo \nbinary fraction is equal to or less than the Galactic disk\nbinary fraction below $0.3 M_\\odot$.   In addition, the more distant\ntertiary VB12, an sdM3.0 companion to an F subdwarf double, \nis also unresolved.  We show that the relation between WFPC2 F555W \nand F850LP photometry and ground V,I photometry is consistent with \ntheoretical expectations.  We also report that two recently observed\nHyades M dwarfs appear single.  \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{binaries: general --- stars: low-mass, brown dwarfs -- \nstars: Population II}\n\n\\section{Introduction\\label{intro}",
