Pairing correlations are taken into \naccount by a finite range two-body force of Gogny type. The \napplicability of this theory to the description of rotating \nnuclei is studied in detail on the example of \nsuperdeformed bands in even-even nuclei of the \n$A\\sim 190$ mass region. Different aspects such as the importance \nof pairing and particle number projection, the dependence of \nthe results on the parametrization of the RMF Lagrangian and \nGogny force etc. are investigated in detail. It is \nshown that without any adjustment of new parameters the \nbest description of experimental data is obtained by using the \nwell established parameter sets NL1 for the Lagrangian \nand D1S for the pairing force. Contrary to previous studies \nat spin zero it is found that the increase of the \nstrength of the Gogny force is not necessary in the\nframework of Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory\nprovided that particle number projection is performed.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\vspace{0.5cm}\n\\pacs{PACS numbers: 21.60.-n, 21.60.Cs, 21.60.Jx, 27.80.+w}\nKeywords: Cranked Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory,\nGogny forces, particle number projection, superdeformation\n\n\\narrowtext\n\n\\input epsf\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\section{Introduction"
