Three new phenomena are observed from low-mass\nX-ray binaries containing low-magnetic-field neutron stars:\nmillisecond pulsations, burst oscillations and kiloHertz\nquasi-periodic oscillations. Models for these new phenomena involve\nthe neutron star spin, and orbital motion closely around the neutron\nstar and rely explicitly on our understanding of strong gravity and\ndense matter. I review the observations of these new neutron-star\nphenomena and possibly related ones in black-hole candidates, and\ndescribe the attempts to use them to perform measurements of\nfundamental physical interest in these systems.}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\\label{sect:intro}\n\n\\vskip-12cm{\\bf Submitted to the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics;\nto appear September 2000",
