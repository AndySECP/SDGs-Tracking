The  electron\ndensities and temperatures are determined, and the method is exemplified \nthrough a detailed analysis of spectral observations of a high excitation \nPN, NGC 6741, observed by \\citet{hyu97}. Fluorescence should\nalso be important in the determination of element abundances.\nIt is suggested that the method could be\ngenerally applied to determine or constrain the luminosity\nand the region of spectral emission in other intensively radiative\nsources such as novae, supernovae, and active galactic nuclei.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n%% Keywords should appear after the \\end{abstract} command.
