I will focus on studies of relatively\nisolated cores that are forming low-mass stars. There is a general\nparadigm for the formation of such stars, and there are detailed\ntheoretical predictions for the evolution of the density and\nvelocity fields for different assumptions about the initial conditions.\nBecause the theory is well developed, observational tests are\nparticularly revealing. The primary probes of physical conditions\nin these regions are discussed and the sensitivity of ALMA to these\nprobes is shown and compared to the current state of the art.\nThe consequences for the ALMA requirements are discussed.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction",
