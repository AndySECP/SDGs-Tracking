The method should be particularly sensitive\nto showers that are transverse to and relatively distant from the\ndetector, and is thus effective in characterizing \npenetrating horizontal showers such as those that \nmight be induced by ultra-high\nenergy neutrino primaries.\n\\end{abstract}\n%\\centerline{PACS codes:  96.40.Pq, 95.55.Vj, 84.40.Xb, 94.10.Gb }\n\\keywords{Cosmic-rays, Cosmic-ray detectors, Extensive air showers, \nNeutrinos, Radar}\n\n\\newpage\n\n\\section{Introduction",
