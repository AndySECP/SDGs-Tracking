We study\ntwo such models and find that they can reproduce rapidity gap data from\nboth HERA and the Tevatron. We also discuss the influence of parton\ncascades and multiple interactions on the results.\n\\end{abstract} \n\n\n%-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n%\\section{Introduction}\n%-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\noindent The rapidity gap events observed at HERA have traditionally been\nexplained by Regge-inspired models based on hard scattering of a parton in \na pomeron, emitted from one of the protons \\cite{IS}. These models work\nwell in reproducing HERA data, but in recent years rapidity gap events\nhave also been observed at the Tevatron \n\\cite{CDF-W,CDF-JJ,Goulianos,CDF-DP,D0-DP,GoulianosWhitmore,CDF-B}. \nThese data cannot be reproduced using a pomeron model with\nparametrizations of the pomeron structure function from HERA data \n\\cite{GoulianosWhitmore,Alvero}. This may indicate that the pomeron\napproach is not universal, e.g. that the pomeron flux factorization\nis not so simple. It is also clear that perturbative \nQCD cannot fully describe the formation of rapidity gaps, since they \ninvolve the soft part of the event, with a long space-time scale.\n\nA different approach has been developed \\cite{SCI,GAL}, where the \nnon-perturbative dynamics is modelled with soft colour exchanges, \nleading to variations in the topology of the \nconfining colour field, e.g.\\ described by Lund strings \\cite{Lund",
