The goal is to study the starburst-AGN connection \nand the origin of the featureless continuum. The results indicate that half\nof the nuclei in the sample harbor a young and/or intermediate age population.\nThese stars are formed in powerful and dusty starbursts of short duration, that have \nbolometric luminosities similar to the estimated bolometric luminosities of \ntheir obscured Seyfert 1 nuclei. \n\\end{abstract}\n%\n%%-----------------------------\n%%      your text\n%%-----------------------------\n\\section{Introduction",
