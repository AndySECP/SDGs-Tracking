I\nshow how the X-ray Background provides a good measure of this energy\nand also why most accretion power is absorbed and re-emitted in the\nfar infrared band. A model for the obscured growth of massive black\nholes is presented which accounts for both the high absorption and the\nobserved black hole to galaxy spheroid mass correlation. Future\nmissions should detect the obscured X-ray sources associated with the\ngrowth of massive black holes.\n\\keywords{}\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction",
