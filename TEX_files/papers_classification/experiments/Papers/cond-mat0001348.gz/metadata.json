Using Confocal Scanning Laser\nMicroscopy we measured the location of each colloid in three dimensions. We\nobserved an equilibrium body-centered tetragonal phase and several\nnon-equilibrium structures such as sheet-like labyrinths and isolated chains of\ncolloids. The formation of non-equilibrium structures was studied as a function\nof the volume fraction, electric field strength and starting configuration of\nthe colloid. We compare our observations to previous experiments, simulations\nand calculations.\n\n\\end{abstract",
