We show rigorously the correctness of this proposal in\nthe case of analytic solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to \na scalar field or stiff fluid. More specifically, we prove the \nexistence of a family of spacetimes depending on the same number of\nfree functions as the general solution which have the asymptotics\nsuggested by the Belinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz proposal near their \nsingularities. In these spacetimes a neighbourhood of the singularity\ncan be covered by a Gaussian coordinate system in which the\nsingularity is simultaneous and the evolution at different spatial\npoints decouples. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\maketitle\n\\tableofcontents\n\n\\section{Introduction}\\label{sec:intro",
