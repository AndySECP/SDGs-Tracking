This computation proceeds by\nreducing to a ``matrix problem''.  Such problems involve finding\nnormal forms for matrices under a specified set of row and column\noperations.  We solve the relevant matrix problem in small dimensional\ncases.  This gives us all conjugacy classes in maximal\nparabolic subgroups over a perfect field when one of the two blocks\nhas dimension less than 6.  In particular, this includes every maximal \nparabolic subgroup of $\\glnk$ for $n<12$ and $k$ a perfect field.  If\nour field is finite of size $q$, we also show that the number of \nconjugacy classes, and so the number of characters, of these groups is \na polynomial in $q$ with integral coefficients.}\n\n\n\\keywords{conjugacy classes, parabolic subgroup, general linear group}\n\n\\begin{article}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nA great deal of progress has been made recently towards describing the\nrepresentation theory of reductive\nalgebraic groups.  For example, the study of representations of finite\nreductive groups was greatly advanced by the work of Deligne and Lusztig\n\\cite{mr52:14076} and has been an active field of research.\nConjugacy classes in reductive groups have been investigated by\nSpringer and Steinberg \\cite{MR42:3091}.  In comparison, little is known for\nsolvable algebraic groups \\cite{MR99b:20011",
