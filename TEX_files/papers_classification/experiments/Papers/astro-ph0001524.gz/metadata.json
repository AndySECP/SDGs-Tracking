The role of the \nelectric potential at the boundary is worked out explicitly. \nAs an example, a modified version of the simple \nspherical $\\alpha$-effect\ndynamo model proposed by Krause and Steenbeck is considered\nin which the $\\alpha$-coefficient is no longer constant but may vary\nwith the radial coordinate. In particular, the results for\nthe original model are re-derived.\nPossible applications of this integral equation approach for\nnumerical simulations of dynamos in arbitrary geometry and\nfor an ''inverse dynamo theory'' are sketched.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction",
