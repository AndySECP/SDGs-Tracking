We show that the recently established \nbijection between Littlewood--Richardson tableaux and rigged \nconfigurations is well-behaved with respect to level-restriction \nand give an explicit characterization of level-restricted rigged\nconfigurations. As a consequence a new general fermionic \nformula for the level-restricted generalized Kostka polynomial\nis obtained. Some coset branching functions of type $A$ are computed\nby taking limits of these fermionic formulas.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\pagestyle{plain}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nGeneralized Kostka polynomials \\cite{KS,SW,S,S2,S3,ShW}\nare $q$-analogues of the tensor product multiplicity\n\\begin{equation}\\label{multi}\n  c^\\la_R = \\dim \\mathrm{Hom}_{\\sln}\n   (V^\\la,V^{R_1} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes V^{R_L",
