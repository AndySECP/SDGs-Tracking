Using spatially\nresolved, deprojected X-ray spectra from the {\\sl ROSAT} PSPC we have\ndetected strong absorption over energies $\\sim 0.4-0.8$ keV intrinsic\nto the central $\\sim 1\\arcmin$ of the galaxy, NGC 1399, the group, NGC\n5044, and the cluster, A1795. These systems have amongst the largest\nnearby cooling flows in their respective classes and low Galactic\ncolumns. Since no excess absorption is indicated for energies below\n$\\sim 0.4$ keV the most reasonable model for the absorber is warm,\ncollisionally ionized gas with $T=10^{5-6}$ K where ionized states of\noxygen provide most of the absorption. Attributing the absorption only\nto ionized gas reconciles the large columns of cold H and He inferred\nfrom {\\sl Einstein} and {\\sl ASCA} with the lack of such columns\ninferred from {\\sl ROSAT}, and also is consistent with the negligible\natomic and molecular H inferred from \\hi\\, and CO observations of\ncooling flows. The prediction of warm ionized gas as the product of\nmass drop-out in these and other cooling flows can be verified by {\\sl\nChandra}, {\\sl XMM}, and {\\sl ASTRO-E}.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{cooling flows -- intergalactic medium -- X-rays: galaxies}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{intro",
