From our $\\chi^2$ analysis,\npolarized $u$-valence, $d$-valence, antiquark, and gluon distributions\nare obtained. We propose one set of leading-order distributions and\ntwo sets of next-to-leading-order ones as the longitudinally-polarized\nparton distribution functions.\n}\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\section{Introduction",
