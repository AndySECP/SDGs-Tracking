Such a \ntransformation has been used to find new solutions that are ``dual'' to the \nKerr family of black hole spacetimes in general relativity. In such a case, \nthe dual solution is a similar black hole spacetime endowed with a global \nmonopole charge. Here, we extend this formalism to obtain solutions dual to\nthe static, spherically symmetric solutions of two different scalar-tensor \ngravity theories. In particular, we first study the duals of the charged black \nhole solutions of a four-dimensional low-energy effective action of heterotic \nstring theory. Next, we study dual of the Xanthopoulos-Zannias solution in \nBrans-Dicke theory, which contains a naked singularity. We show that, \nanalogous to general relativity, in these scalar-tensor gravity theories the \ndual solutions are similar to the original spacetimes, but with a \nglobal monopole charge.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{Pacs: 04.20.Jb, 04.70.Bw, 11.27.+d, 98.80.Cq} \n\n\\narrowtext\n\n\\vfil\n\\pagebreak\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro"
