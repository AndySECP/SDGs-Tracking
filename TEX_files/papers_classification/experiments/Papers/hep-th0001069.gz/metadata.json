The set of\nsolutions of this equation is obtained in the form of the product of two\ndifferent systems of generalized coherent states for the de Sitter group.\nUsing  these solutions the quantized Dirac field over de Sitter space\nis constructed and its propagator is found. It is\n a result of action of some de Sitter invariant spinor operator onto the\nspin zero propagator with an imaginary shift of a mass.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction",
