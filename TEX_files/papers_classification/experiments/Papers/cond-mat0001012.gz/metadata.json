Physical examples include\ncurrent states in small metallic loops\\cite{Gefen}, \nspin tunneling in magnetic molecules\\cite{MolecularMagnets}, \nAndreev states in SNS junctions \\cite{AndreevStates}, \nslow atomic and molecular collisions\\cite{Atomic}, \nelectron transfer in biomolecules\\cite{Biophysics}. \n%It also describes the adiabatic flip of a qubit\n%and thus may be important for the physics of quantum computing.\nReal-world two-state systems are typically coupled to the environment,\nand this coupling may lead to different physical effects.\nThis coupling provides dissipation and slows the tunneling down.\nOn the other hand, thermal noise in the environment may \ncause non-adiabatic transition.\nThe competition between these two effects makes the problem\nof dissipative Landau--Zener tunneling very interesting.\n\nAlso, the Landau--Zener tunneling \nis of interest in the context of quantum computing, \nbecause\nit  describes the adiabatic flip of a qubit.\nDuring the process of the flip, \nthe qubit is \nin a superposition of the pure ``on'' and ``off'' states  \n%not in stable  ``on'' or ``off'' state, \nand thus may be very sensitive to environmental noise. Thus, the problem\nof dissipative Landau--Zener tunneling may be important for the \nphysical implementation of the qubit. \n\nPrevious works on the \ndissipative Landau--Zener tunneling \ntreated the problem either perturbatively or phenomenologically \n\\cite{Gefen,GefenAdiabatic,Ultrahigh,Rammer,Shimshoni}.\nPerturbative treatment, however, is insufficient\nfor adiabatic limit, because it\nposes too strong limitations on coupling strength.\nPhenomenological\napproach is satisfactory only for high temperatures.\nAlso, previous works focused primarily on the case of Ohmic\ncoupling which is critical for equilibrium  tunneling\\cite{CaldeiraLeggett",
