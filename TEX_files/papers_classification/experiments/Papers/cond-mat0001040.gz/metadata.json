For $d=2$ \nI find $\\nu_{s}=0.81$ and $\\nu_c =1.03$,  for \nshort-range and  Coulomb interactions between bosons,\nrespectively. When combined \nwith the exact values of the dynamical critical exponents,\nthese results are in quantitative agreement with the experiments on\nonset of superfluidity in $^4 He$ in porous glasses,\nand on superconductor-insulator transition in homogeneous metallic films.\n\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\vspace{10pt",
