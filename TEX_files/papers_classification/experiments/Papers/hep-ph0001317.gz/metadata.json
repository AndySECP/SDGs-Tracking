We focus on the processes \n$B\\to DK,~B_s\\to D_s K$, and on charmless decays to two light pseudoscalars \nand decays to a pair of a pseudoscalar and a vector meson. Theoretical \nuncertainties underlying these methods are discussed.}\n\n\\newpage\n\\section{Introduction}\n$B$ meson decays open the window into new phenomena of CP nonconservation, \nproviding useful information about CP violating phases \\cite{MGrev}.\nPhase measurements for $\\alpha,~\\beta$ and $\\gamma$, which\nare not independent in the Kobayashi-Maskawa framework, are important for two \nreasons. First, they improve to a higher \nprecision our knowledge of the CKM mixing matrix, consisting of fundamental \nquark couplings in our present theory. And second, they are sensitive probes \nfor sources of CP violation outside the CKM matrix, and for new flavor changing \ninteractions contributing to $B^0-\\bar B^0$ mixing and to rare $B$ decays. \n\nThe phase $\\beta \\equiv{\\rm Arg}(-V^*_{cb}V_{cd}/V^*_{tb}V_{td",
