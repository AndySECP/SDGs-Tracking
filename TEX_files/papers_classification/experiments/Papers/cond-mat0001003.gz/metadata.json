It is well-known \nthat there are \nlow energy quasiparticles bound to the core of a vortex. \nWe show that under certain conditions, these quasiparticles form a \ndegenerate Fermi gas with a finite density of states at the Fermi energy. \nIn three dimensional superconductors, the result is a one dimensional \nFermi gas of quasiparticles bound to the core of a vortex line. \nAs is usual in one dimensional systems, \ninteractions between the quasiparticles lead to Luttinger liquid \nbehaviour. This may be probed through STM tunneling into the vortex core. \nWe further suggest that a novel Peierls-type instability in the shape of\nthe vortex line may develop due to interactions between the quasiparticle gas and \nfluctuations in the vortex line shape.  \n \n\\end{abstract}\n\\vspace{0.15cm}\n\n%\\pacs{PACS numbers:75.10.Nr, 05.50.+q, 75.10.Jm}\n%\\vskip -0.5 truein\n\\begin{multicols}{2}\n%\\narrowtext\n%\\newpage  \n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{Intro}\nThe electronic properties of Type $II$ superconductors in the mixed\nphase are known to have several interesting features. In some\npioneering work, Caroli et. al.\\cite{cmdg} predicted theoretically the\nexistence of low energy quasiparticle states bound to the core of a\nsingle isolated vortex in an $s$-wave superconductor.  These low lying\nstates are free to move parallel to the vortex, and so give rise to a\nseries of one dimensional bands (\\emph{minibands",
