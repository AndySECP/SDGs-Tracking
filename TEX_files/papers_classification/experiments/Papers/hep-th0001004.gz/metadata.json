I show here that the assumption\nin such work that the mirror can be treated as an external field is\ninvalid, and the exotic energy--transfer effects necessary to the\nparadoxes are well below the scales at which the model is credible.  A\nmodel with a first--quantized point--particle mirror is considered; for\nthis it appears that exotic energy--transfers are\nlost in the quantum uncertainty in the mirror's state.\nExamining the physics giving rise to these limitations shows that an\naccurate accounting of these energies will require a model which\nrecognizes the mirror's finite reflectivity, and almost certainly a\nmodel which allows for the excitation of internal mirror modes, that is,\na second--quantized model.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{03.70.+k, 05.70.-a}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%\n%% delete the \\wideabs line for final submission\n}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\def\\T{{\\widehat T}}\n\\def\\scri{{\\cal I}}\n\\def\\dddot#1{{\\partial _t^3{{#1}}}}\n\\def\\H{{\\widehat H}}\n\\def\\e{{e}}\n\n%\\narrowtext\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nAlmost twenty--five years ago, Davies and\nFulling~\\cite{davies76,fulling76}, following a suggestion of\nDeWitt~\\cite{dewitt75} (see also~\\cite{moore70",
