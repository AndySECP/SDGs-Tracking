We calculate $\\alpha$ exactly for\ndifferent competing strategies, including the hash-rehash and \nthe skewed-associative strategies which were earlier analyzed\nvia simulations. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{PACS: 07.05.Bx, 07.05.Tp, 02.50.-r}\n\n\n\\begin{multicols}{2}\n\n\n\n%%  The problem of main memory in a computer\n\nThe memory of a computer is organized in {\\em pages.} A single page\nconsists of several {\\em words.} As the computer performs its computations,\nit reads from and writes into memory. \nWhen a word of main memory is accessed, the\nentire page containing the word is fetched and stored in a {\\em more\naccessible} part of the computer's hardware called the {\\em cache}, which\nadmits fast access. Subsequent accesses are likely to be for \nwords in this page and hence the average memory access time is\nconsiderably reduced\\cite{Hwang-Briggs84",
