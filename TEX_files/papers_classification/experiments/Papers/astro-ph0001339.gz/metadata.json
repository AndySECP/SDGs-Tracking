The correlation is \nmarginally significant; the spectral hardness of the bursts with \nradio afterglows apparently results from a combination of the break \nenergy E$_{\\rm break}$ and the high-energy spectral index $\\beta$. \nIf valid, this relationship would indicate that the afterglow does \ncarry information pertaining to the GRB central engine.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section*{Introduction",
