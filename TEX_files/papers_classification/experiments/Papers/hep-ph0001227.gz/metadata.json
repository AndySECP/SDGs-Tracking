Although scalar confinement does not follow from\nQCD, there is an interesting and close relationship between them. We\ndevelop a simple model intermediate between scalar confinement and the QCD\nstring for illustrative purposes.  Finally, we find the bound state masses\nof scalar, time-component vector, and string confinement analytically\nthrough semi-classical quantization.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{}\n}  %% end wideabstract\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\\label{sec:intro}\n\nGoing beyond the non-relativistic potential model of quark confinement\nmeans that more than the static interaction energy must be specified.  In\nthe language of potential models the Lorentz nature of the interaction is\nneeded.  To agree with the observed spin-orbit splitting it was proposed\nlong ago \\cite{ref:one",
