It is shown that the q-defomation\nof bosonic commutation relations is satisfied naturally by the exciton operators when\nthe low density limit is deviated.\r An analytical expression of the \nphysical spectrum for the exciton is given by using of the dressed states of \nthe cavity field and the exciton. We also give the numerical study and compare\nthe  theoretical results with the experimental results\n\\end{abstract}\n\\vspace{4mm",
