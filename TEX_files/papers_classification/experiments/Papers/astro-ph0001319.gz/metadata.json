So far, we have compiled a sample of more than 70 X-ray\nselected clusters at $|b|<20^{\\circ}$, 80\\% of which were previously\nunknown. Upon its completion the CIZA cluster catalogue will\ncomplement the existing galaxy surveys in the Galactic plane region\nand allow a fresh look at large-scale structure and local streaming\nmotions.\n%\n\\end{abstract}\n%\n%\n\\section{Introduction"
