In ensuing  discussions we shall use $T$ \nto also \ndenote the spanning tree.\n\nNumber the vertices from 1 to $|V|$ and associate \nto the edge $e_{ij}$ connecting vertices $i$ and $j$\na weight $x_{ij}$,\nwith the convention of $x_{ii}=0$.\nThe enumeration of spanning trees concerns with the \nevaluation of the tree generating function\n\\begin{equation}\nT(G;\\{x_{ij}\\",
