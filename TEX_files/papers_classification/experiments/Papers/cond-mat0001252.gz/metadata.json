We\ntune the relative strengths of the two interactions and measure them as a\nfunction of the number of confined electrons. We find that electrons tend to\nhave parallel spins when they occupy nearly degenerate single-particle\nstates. We use a magnetic field to adjust the single-particle state\ndegeneracy, and find that the spin-configurations in an arbitrary magnetic\nfield are well explained in terms of two-electron singlet and triplet states.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{73.20.Dx, 72.20.My, 73.40.Gk",
