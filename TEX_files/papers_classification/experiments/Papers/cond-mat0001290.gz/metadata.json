Other morphological and kinetic features amenable\nof experimental observation are outlined, suggesting new directions for further\nvalidation of the model. \n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\begin{multicols}{2}\n\\narrowtext\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nMechanical, electronic or magnetic properties of many polycrystallline\nmaterials depend not\nonly on their chemical composition, but also on the kinetic path  of these\nmaterials toward the non-equilibrium state. Recently, the interest on thin film\ntransistors made of polycrystalline Si and Si--Ge grown by low-pressure\nchemical vapor deposition has been driven by the technological development of\nactive matrix addressed flat-panel displays\\cite{Im} and thin film solar\ncells.\\cite{Bergmann}  With these and similar applications in mind, the\ncapability to engineer the size and geometry of grains becomes crucial to\ndesign materials with the required properties. \n\n\nIn general, crystallization  of most materials takes place by a nucleation and\ngrowth mechanism:\\cite{Zellama} Nucleation  starts with the appearance of\nsmall atom clusters ({\\em embryos",
