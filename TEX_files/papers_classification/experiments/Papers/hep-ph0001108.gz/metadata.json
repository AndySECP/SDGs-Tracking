The ``QCD-like theory'' means \nthe improved ladder approximation with an infrared cutoff \nin terms of a modified running coupling. \nThe form of Cornwall--Jackiw--Tomboulis effective potential is modified \nby the use of the Schwinger--Dyson equation for generally nonzero current \nquark mass. \nWe then calculate the effective potential at finite $T$ and/or $\\mu$ \nand investigate the phase structure in the chiral limit. \nWe have a second-order phase transition at $T_c=129$ MeV for $\\mu=0$ \nand a first-order one at $\\mu_c=422$ MeV for $T=0$. \nA tricritical point in the $T$-$\\mu$ plane is found \nat $T=107$ MeV, $\\mu=210$ MeV. The position is close to that of \nthe random matrix model and some version of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model.\n\\end{abstract",
