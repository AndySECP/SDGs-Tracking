The principle is compatible with the\nboundary-value problem of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations, and\nleads to ``natural boundary conditions'' on the shell. These conditions\nand the gravitational field equations which follow from an initial\nvariational principle, are used for elimination of the gravitational\ndegrees of  freedom. The transformation of the variational formula for\nspherically-symmetric systems leads to two natural variants of the\neffective action.  One of these variants describes the shell from a\nstationary interior observer's point of view, another from the exterior\none. The conditions of isometry of the exterior and interior faces of the\nshell lead to the momentum and Hamiltonian constraints. The canonical\nequivalence of the mentioned systems is shown in the extended phase space.\nSome particular cases are considered.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{PACS numbers: 04.20.-q, 04.20.Fy, 04.40.-b} \\narrowtext\n\\newpage\n\\section{INTRODUCTION}\n\nA thin spherically-symmetric dust shell is among the simplest popular\nmodels of collapsing gravitating configurations. The equations of motion\nof these objects are obtained in \\cite{israel1}, \\cite{kuchar1}. The\nconstruction of a variational principle for such systems was discussed\nfrom different points of view in \\cite{visser}-\\cite{berezin3",
