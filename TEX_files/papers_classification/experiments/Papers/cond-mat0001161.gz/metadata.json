The model\n  allows us to show explicitly a subaging behavior and multiple\n  scaling regimes for the correlation function. Both the exponents\n  characterizing the scaling of the different relaxation times with\n  the waiting time and those characterizing the asymptotic decay of\n  the scaling functions are obtained analytically by invoking a\n  `partial equilibrium' concept.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{PACS numbers: 02.50.-r, 75.10.Nr, 05.20.-y}\n% 02.50.-r Probability theory, stochastic processes, and statistics\n% 75.10.Nr Spin-glass and other random models\n% 05.20.-y Classical statistical mechanics\n\n\\begin{multicols}{2}\n\\narrowtext\n\nThe dynamics of glassy materials can be strongly dependent on the\nhistory of glass formation \\cite{Zarzycki:1991,Parisi:1999}. Generally\nspeaking, one finds that the relaxation dynamics becomes increasingly\nslower with the ``age'' of the system, that means with the time $t_w$\nexpired since the material was brought into the glassy state. Such\naging phenomena have been identified in many systems and various\ndynamical probes (for a recent review, see\ne.g.~\\cite{Bouchaud/etal:1998",
