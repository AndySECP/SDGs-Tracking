These images have allowed us to\nstudy the detailed morphology of shock-excited emission present in\nthe bipolar lobes of this object. These images reveal the presence of\nthree highly collimated outflows emanating from the central regions\nof GL 618. We discuss the significance of the detection of these\noutflows and the possible origins of these features.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction",
