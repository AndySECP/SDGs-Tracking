However, more \nrecently, there has been theoretical evidence that, in the realm of \nstring/M-theory, this symmetry may be violated. \nThis naturally poses the question of verifying this violation \nexperimentally. \nIn this contribution\\footnote{Invited \ntalk delivered at the Third Meeting on Constrained Dynamics and \nQuantum Gravity, Villasimius, Sardinia, September 1999.",
