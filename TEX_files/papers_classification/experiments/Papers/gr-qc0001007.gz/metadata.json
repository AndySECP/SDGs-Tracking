We show that flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universes and open dust-filled and radiation-filled universes are singularity free when described in terms of the formulation of general relativity conformal to the canonical one.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\pacs{04.20.-q, 04.20.Dw, 04.70.Bw}\n\n\n\nOne of the most undesirable features of general relativity is the ocurrence of spacetime singularities where the laws of physics breakdown. The famous Hawking-Penrose singularity theorems predict that, if ordinary matter obeys some reasonable energy conditions, then the ocurrence of spacetime singularities in general relativity is inevitable\\cite{haw}. In particular, the initial singularity is a problem in standard general relativity given by the action:\n\n$$\nS=\\frac{1}{16\\pi}\\int d^4x \\sqrt{-\\hat g}(\\hat R+16\\pi \\hat L_{matter",
