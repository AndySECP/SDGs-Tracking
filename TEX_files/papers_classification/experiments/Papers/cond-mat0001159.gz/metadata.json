We\ndistinguish the latter {\\it mechanical} quantity from the {\\it\nthermodynamic} work of adhesion, and we describe explicitly how both\nmay be calculated.  Our formulae for interfacial and surface energies\nare cast in terms of quantities which can be calculated or looked up in\ntables, and include as additional parameters the ambient temperature\nand partial pressure of oxygen $P_{O_2",
