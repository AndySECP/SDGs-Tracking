Under the heavily\ndamping cases, the mirror variables are adiabatically eliminated.\n The the stationary conditions of the system are discussed. \nThe small fluctuation approximation around steady values is applied to\n analysis the antibunching effect of the cavity field. The antibunching \n condition is given under two limit cases. \n\\end{abstract}\n\\vspace{4mm",
