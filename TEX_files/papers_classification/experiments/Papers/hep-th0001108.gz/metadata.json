With this aim in view,\nexact solutions of Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations are found in the\nmagnetic-solenoid field. Using such solutions, we calculate exactly all the\ncharacteristics of one-photon spontaneous radiation both for spinless and\nspinning particle. Considering non-relativistic and relativistic\napproximations, we analyze cyclotron and synchrotron radiations in detail.\nRadiation peculiarities caused by the presence of the solenoid may be\nconsidered as a manifestation of Aharonov-Bohm effect in the radiation. In\nparticular, it is shown that new spectral lines appear in the radiation\nspectrum. Due to angular distribution peculiarities of the radiation\nintensity, these lines can in principle be isolated from basic cyclotron and\nsynchrotron radiation spectra.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction",
