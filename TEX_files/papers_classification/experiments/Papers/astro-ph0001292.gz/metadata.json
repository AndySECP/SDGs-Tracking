The position of the Doppler peak is\nfairly sensitive to changes in $c$, and future observations should \ndramatically improve this bound. On the other hand, we also find that the\nmaximum baryonic density allowed in VSL theories is\nabout $\\Omega_B h^2\\sim 0.06\\Omega_0$. We comment on the significance\nof these results.}\n\n\\end{abstract",
