We compare the predicted simple stellar population colors of three \npopulation synthesis models to the intrinsic colors of Galactic and \nM31 globular clusters.\nThe best-fitting models fit the cluster colors very well -- the\nweighted mean color offsets are all $<0.05$ mag.\nThe most significant offsets between model and data are in the $U$ and \n$B$ passbands; these are not unexpected and are likely due to\nproblems with the spectral libraries used by the models.\nThe metal-rich clusters (${\\rm [Fe/H]",
