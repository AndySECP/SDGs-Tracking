We find a unified\ndescription of the statistics of the monitored quantity, the current, in the\nregime of strong measurement and expect this description to apply for a wide \nclass of quantum measurements.  We derive the probability distributions for the\ncurrent and charge in different stages of the process.  In the parameter regime\nof the strong measurement the current develops a telegraph-noise behavior which\ncan be detected in the noise spectrum.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\paragraph*{Introduction.}\nThe long-standing interest in fundamental questions of the quantum\nmeasurement received new impetus by the experimental progress in\nmesoscopic physics and increasing activities in quantum state\nengineering. The basic idea is to use as meter a device, able\nto carry a macroscopic current, which is\ncoupled to the quantum system such that the conductance\ndepends on the quantum state. By monitoring the current one\nperforms a quantum measurement, which,\nin turn, causes a dephasing of the quantum\nsystem~\\cite{Aleiner,Levinson,Gurvitz}. The dephasing has\nbeen demonstrated in an experiment of Buks et al.~\\cite{Buks",
