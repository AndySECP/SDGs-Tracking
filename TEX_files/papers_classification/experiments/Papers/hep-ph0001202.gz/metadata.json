We determine the time $\\tau_{eq}$\nwhere close to ideal\nhydrodynamic flow sets in, and find rather similar numbers for\ncentral heavy-ion collisions at BNL-RHIC and CERN-LHC energies.\nThe number densities, \nenergy densities and temperatures of the minijet plasma\nare found to be different at RHIC and LHC, e.g.\\\n$T(\\tau_{eq",
