The recent SuperKamiokande discovery of neutrino mass gives an {\\it aper\\c cu} of physics at short distances, and tests theories of flavor.   \nQuark-lepton symmetries, derived from  grand unification and/or string\ntheories, can help determine the  standard model parameters in the neutrino sector.\n\n\\end{abstract",
