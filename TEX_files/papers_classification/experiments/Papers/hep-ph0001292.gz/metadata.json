We discuss the cosmological motivation for considering \nthe electroweak phase transition in the presence of an external \nmagnetic field, the analogies this system might have with the \nsuperconductor behaviour described above, and in particular \nwhether at large physical Higgs masses, corresponding to the \nhigh-$T_c$ regime, an analogue of the vortex phase and an associated \nfirst order phase transition could be generated.} \n\n\n\\vspace*{-8cm}\n\\begin{flushright} CERN-TH/2000-031\\\\ hep-ph/0001292\n\\end{flushright}\n\\vspace*{6.5cm}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nOne possible explanation for the baryon asymmetry of the Universe\nis that it was generated in a 1st order electroweak phase \ntransition\\cite{krs",
