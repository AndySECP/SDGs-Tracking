The release of the homogeneous IUE  final  archive\nand the availability of the high-accuracy {\\it Hipparcos} parallaxes\nprovide an opportunity to revisit this issue, as   accurate stellar\ndistances make it possible to compare observed absolute fluxes with\nthe predictions of model atmospheres.\n\nThe near-UV continuum is highly sensitive to $T_{\\rm eff}$  and [Fe/H],\nand once the gravity is constrained from the  parallax, these\nparameters may be derived from the analysis of  low-dispersion {\\it\nlong-wavelength",
