It is shown that canting of spins is not allowed at $x=0.3$\nthough is at $x=0.4$. The observed magnetic reflections from the sample with\n$x=0.3$ may be described as arising from two spatially distributed\nphases with close transition temperatures but different easy axes and ranges\nof stability. Experimental results are revisited on the basis of the theoretical findings.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\vspace{0.2in",
