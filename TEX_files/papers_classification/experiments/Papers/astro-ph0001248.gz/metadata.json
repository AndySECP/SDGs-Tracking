The\ncosmological results based on distances to Type Ia events have been\nspectacular, leading to statistically accurate values of the Hubble constant\nand $\\Omega_{M}$ and $\\Omega_\\Lambda$.\n\nHowever, in spite of the recent advances, a number of mysteries continue to\nremain in our understanding of these events. In this short review, I will\nconcentrate on unresolved problems and curious correlations in the data on\nType Ia SNe, whose resolution may lead to a deeper understanding of the\nphysical mechanism of the Type Ia supernova explosions.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section*{Introduction}\n\nThe study of supernovae is certainly in vogue today. Type II plateau and Type\nIa supernovae are used to measure distances to galaxies into the quiet Hubble\nflow out past 10,000 km s$^{-1}$ to determine the Hubble constant (see for\ninstance \\cite{Sunetal99,Jhaetal99,Gibetal00} for Type Ia distance scales, and\n\\cite{Schetal94",
