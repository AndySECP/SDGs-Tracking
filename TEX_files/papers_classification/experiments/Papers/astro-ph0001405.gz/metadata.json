The opening angle is shown to be\nthe ratio of the  power output of the inner fireball to that of\nthe exterior baryonic wind. The gamma ray burst 990123 might thus\nbe interpreted as a baryon-pure jet with an energy output  of\norder  10$^{50}$ erg or less, collimated by a baryonic wind from\na torus with an energy output of order $10^{52}$ erg.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{Pacs Numbers: 98.70.Rz, 95.30.Lz}\n\\end{titlepage}\n\n%\\section{Introduction",
