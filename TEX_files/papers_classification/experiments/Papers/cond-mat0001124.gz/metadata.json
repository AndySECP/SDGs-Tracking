Asymmetric \nquantum wells confine electrons along the pillar axis and a negatively \nbiased gate wrapped around the center of the pillar allows for electrostatic \nconfinement in the radial direction. We self-consistently solve \ncoupled Schr\\\"{o}dinger and Poisson equations and develop \na design for a three-qubit quantum register. Our results indicate that a \nsingle gate electrode can be used to localize a single electron in each \nof the quantum dots. Adjacent dots are strongly coupled by electric \ndipole-dipole interactions arising from the dot asymmetry, thus enabling \nrapid computation rates. The dots are tailored to minimize dephasing due to \nspontaneous emission and phonon scattering and to maximize the number of \ncomputation cycles. The design is scalable to a large number of qubits.\n\n\\end{abstract",
