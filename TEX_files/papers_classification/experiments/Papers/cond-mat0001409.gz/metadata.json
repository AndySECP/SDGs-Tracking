Since properties of a polynomial\nare completely determined by its roots,\na knowledge of the zeroes of the partition function \nyields all thermodynamic properties of the system.  Particularly,\nif the  zeroes lie on a certain locus, a knowledge of its \ndensity distribution along the locus is equivalent to the obtaining of\nthe exact solution of the problem.\n\nFor the Ising model with ferromagnetic interactions,  we have the remarkable\nYang-Lee circle theorem \\cite{yanglee} which \nstates that all  partition function zeroes\nlie on the unit circle $|z|=1$\nin the complex $z=e^{2L",
