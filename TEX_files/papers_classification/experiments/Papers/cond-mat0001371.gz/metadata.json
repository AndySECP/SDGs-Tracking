The temperature of the metal to nonmagnetic Mott insulator\ntransition decreases under pressure, and vanishes at the quantum critical\npoint $p_{\\rm cr}=20$kbar. We find two kinds of anomalous conducting\nstates. The high-pressure metallic phase is a\nnon-Fermi liquid described by $\\Delta\\rho\\propto T^{n}$ where $n=$1.2--1.3\nat 1K$<T<$60K. At $p<p_{\\rm cr}$, the transition is preceded by a wide\nprecursor region with critically increasing resistivity which we\nascribe to the opening of a soft Coulomb gap. \n\\end{abstract} \n\\pacs{71.10.Hf, 71.30.+h, 72.80.Ga, 71.27.+a}\n\n \nUnderstanding the Mott transition, and clarifying the nature of the phases on  \neither side of the transition, is a matter of great importance.  \nThough metal--insulator transitions are often accompanied  by an ordering  \ntransition and/or influenced by disorder, one may speak about a ``pure''  \nMott transition which is a local correlation effect in an ideal lattice \nfermion system, \nand takes place without breaking any global symmetry.  Many aspects  \nof this problem can be studied on the multifaceted behavior of BaVS$_3$  \n\\cite{Graf,hall,first}.\n  \nThe metal--insulator transition of the nearly isotropic 3D compound \nBaVS$_3$ offers a realization \nof the pure Mott transition in nature \\cite{first}. Under atmospheric pressure \nBaVS$_3$ has  \nthree transitions: the hexagonal-to-orthorhombic transition at $T_S=240$K  \nwhich has only a slight effect on the electrical properties; the \nmetal--insulator transition  \nat $T_{\\rm  MI}=69$K, which does not seem to break any of the  \nsymmetries of the metallic phase; and the ordering transition at  \n$T_X=30$K \\cite{order}.  \nIn spite of decades of effort, the character of the phases  \nand the driving force of the transitions at $T_{\\rm  MI}$ and $T_X$, remain  \nmysterious. \n \nHere we report the results of single crystal resistivity measurements under  \nhydrostatic pressure in the range of 1bar $\\le p<$ 25kbar. These pressures  \nencompass the entire insulating phase and part of a high-pressure  \nlow-$T$ conducting phase. We report the first observation of the \nquantum critical point in  \nBaVS$_3$, and we characterize the strange metallic phase lying beyond  \nthe critical pressure $p_{\\rm cr",
