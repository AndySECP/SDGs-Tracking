The \nparticles are excited by periodic forcing of one of the side \nwalls. Our data suggests that strongly \nnon-Gaussian velocity distributions can occur in dilute granular \nmaterials even in the absence of significant density correlations or clustering. \nWhen the surface on which the particles roll is tilted further to introduce \nstronger gravitation, the collision frequency with the driving wall increases \nand the velocity component distributions approach Gaussian distributions of different widths. \n\\end{abstract",
