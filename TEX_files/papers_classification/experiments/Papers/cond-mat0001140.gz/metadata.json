In the present paper the \nelasticity of such chains is studied in detail. Different \ndeformation regimes \nare addressed. The first is the continuous regime, where many\npearls are present. A continuous force extension relation ship is \ncalculated. The main contribution comes from the tension balance\nand the electrostatic repulsion of consecutive pearls.\nThe main correction term stems from the finite size of the \npearls, which monitors their surface energy. For a finite amount\nof pearls discontinuous stretching is predicted. Finally\ncounterion effects are discussed qualitatively.\n\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{PACS Numbers: 36.20.-r,61.25.Hq,61.41.+e}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nRecently it has become possible to manipulate single polymer chains and to\nexperimentally study their elastic response \\cite{chatellier:98,wilder:98}.\nOur aim here is to describe theoretically the single chain elasticity in the\nspecific case of polyelectrolytes in poor solvents, typically in water, a poor\nsolvent for most organic polyelectrolyte backbones. Beside the direct\nexperimental measurements of single chain elasticity, there are at least two\nother motivations for this study: the possible relation with drag reduction\n\\cite{degennes:86,mumick:94",
