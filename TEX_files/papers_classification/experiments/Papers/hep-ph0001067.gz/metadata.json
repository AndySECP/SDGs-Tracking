The formulas are used to study the \nelectromagnetic properties of a plasma\nthat contains a beam of neutrinos.\nThe transverse and longitudinal photon dispersion relations\nare studied in some detail.\nOur results do not support the idea that\nneutrino streaming instabilities can develop in such a system.\nWe also indicate how the phenomenon of optical activity of the neutrino\ngas is modified due to the velocity of the neutrino background relative\nto the plasma.\nThe general approach and results can be adapted to similar problems \ninvolving relativistic plasmas and high-temperature gauge theories\nin other environments.\n\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction and Conclusions}\n\\label{sec:intro",
