A chaotic map is assigned to each data-point and short range couplings are\nintroduced. The stationary regime of the system corresponds to a macroscopic attractor independent of\nthe initial conditions. The mutual information between pairs of maps serves to partition the data set in\nclusters, without prior assumptions about the structure of the underlying\ndistribution of the data. Experiments on simulated and real data sets show the effectiveness of the\nproposed algorithm.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{PACS Numbers: 02.50.Rj, 89.70.+c, 05.45.Ra }\n\n%\\section{Introduction"
