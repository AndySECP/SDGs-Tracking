Our results also apply when one or both of the superconductors is a bulk material, and include the usually neglected effects of surface states.  For weak tunneling, our results reduce to our previous results derived using the tunneling Hamiltonian.   Our results are also correct for strong tunneling. However, the $c$-axis tunneling expressions of Tanaka and Kashiwaya are shown to be incorrect in any limit. In addition, we consider the $c$-axis coherent critical current between two identical layered superconductors twisted an angle $\\phi_0$ about the $c$-axis with respect to each other.  Regardless of the order parameter symmetry, our coherent tunneling results using a tight-binding intralayer quasiparticle dispersion are inconsistent with the recent $c$-axis twist bicrystal Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ twist junction experiments of Li {\\it et al.} \n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{74.50.+r, 74.60.Jg, 74.80.Dm, 74.72.Hs}\n]\n\\narrowtext\n\n\n%\\newpage\n\\section{Introduction",
