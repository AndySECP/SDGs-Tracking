A massive observing \ncampaign of five microlensing collaborations was unable to break this \ndegeneracy photometrically in the case of the binary lensing event MACHO \n98-SMC-1.  We show that this degeneracy indeed causes the image centroids\nof the wide and close solutions to follow an extremely similar pattern of\nmotion during the time when the source is in or near the caustic.  \nNevertheless, the two image centroids are displaced from one another and\nthis displacement is detectable by observing the event at late times.\nPhotometric degeneracies therefore can be resolved astrometrically, even\nfor these most severe cases.\n\n\n\n\\keywords{astrometry -- Galaxy: stellar content -- gravitational lensing\n-- Magellanic Clouds}\n\n\\end{abstract} \n\n\\section{Introduction"
