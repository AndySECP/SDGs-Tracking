The characterization of the initial state,\n which is\n assumed to be restricted to one side  of the barrier, and the time\n evolution of the density matrix lead to a three-fold path integral which\nis evaluated in the semiclassical limit. The semiclassical trajectories\nare found to move in the complex coordinate plane and barrier penetration\nonly arises due to fluctuations.\nBoth the form of the semiclassical paths and the relevant fluctuations change\nsignificantly as a function of temperature. The semiclassical analysis leads to\na detailed picture of barrier penetration in the real time domain\nand the changeover from thermal activation to quantum tunneling.\nDeep tunneling is associated with quasi-zero modes in the fluctuation\nspectrum about the semiclassical orbits in the long\ntime limit. The connection between this real time description of\ntunneling and the standard imaginary time instanton approach\nis established. Specific results are given for a double well potential\nand an Eckart barrier.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{PACS numbers:03.65.Sq,82.20.Db,05.40.+j}\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nSemiclassical theories have been found extremely powerful in\nunderstanding the dynamics of complex quantum mechanical systems.\n Special attention has been \npaid to theories of tunneling processes as they occur in\nphysics, chemistry, and biology. Currently, a variety of\nquantum rate theories are in use explaining experimental\nfindings for several situations of interest \\cite{hanggi",
