For\nthese two alternatives analytical expressions are obtained for the LCAO electron\nwave functions suitable for the treatment of electron superexchange. Simple\nformulae for the Fermi surface and electron dispersions are derived by applying the L\\\"owdin down-fold procedure to set up the effective copper and oxygen Hamiltonians. They\nare used to fit the experimental ARUPS Fermi surface of\nPb$_{0.42}$Bi$_{1.73}$Sr$_{1.94}$Ca$_{1.3}$Cu$_{1.92}$O$_{8+x}$ and both the\nARPES and LDA Fermi surface of $\\NCCO$.\nThe value of presenting the hopping amplitudes as surface\nintegrals of {\\it ab initio} atomic wave functions is demonstrated as well. The same approach is\napplied to the RuO$_2$ plane of the ruthenate Sr$_2$RuO$_4.$ The LCAO Hamiltonians\nincluding the three in-plane $\\pi$-orbitals Ru4$d_{xy},$ O$_{\\rm a}2p_y,$\nO$_{\\rm b}2p_x$ and the four transversal $\\pi$-orbitals Ru4$d_{zx},$\nRu4$d_{yz},$ O$_{\\rm a}2p_z,$ O$_{\\rm b}2p_z,$ are separately considered. It is\nshown that the equation for the constant energy curves and the Fermi contours\nhas the same canonical form as the one for the layered cuprates.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{74.25.Jb, 71.25.Pi, 74.72.-h}\n\\submitted{Published in J.
