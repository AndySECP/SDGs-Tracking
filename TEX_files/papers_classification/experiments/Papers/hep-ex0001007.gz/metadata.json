We derive the reach\nfor several channels: $2\\gamma$ inclusive, $2\\gamma+1$ jet,\nand $2\\gamma+2$ jets. We present the expected Run II limits\non the branching ratio of $h\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma$\nas a function of the Higgs mass, for the case of ``bosonic'',\nas well as ``topcolor'' Higgs bosons.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\section*{Motivation",
