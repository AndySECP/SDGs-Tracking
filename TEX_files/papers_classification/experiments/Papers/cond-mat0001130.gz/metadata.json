Our general formalism allows us to explicitly\n  consider the Bragg reflections due to the perturbation-induced\n  periodicity.  As an example we calculate the effective masses in the\n  lowest two conduction bands of spontaneously ordered GaInP$_{2}$ as a\n  function of the degree of ordering. Comparison of our results for the\n  lowest conduction band to available experimental data and to first\n  principle calculations shows good agreement.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{71.20.Nr,71.15.Th,71.18.+y}\n\\narrowtext\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\nFor many years $\\kdotp$ theory\\cite{kane:66,call:74",
