After a local shift of the order parameter the fluctuations\nare around the ground state, and a perturbative calculation for $F_q$\ncan be carried out. Power scaling between $F_q$'s is shown, and a universal\nscaling exponent $\\nu\\simeq 1.75$ is given for the case with weak\ncorrelations and weak self-interactions.\n\n{{\\bf PACS",
