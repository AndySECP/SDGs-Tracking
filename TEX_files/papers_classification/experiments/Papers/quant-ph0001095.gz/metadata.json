We find that a stochastic resonance \nbehavior in the steady-state response of the system is present whenever \nthe noise-induced relaxation dynamics can be characterized via a single \nrelaxation time scale. The picture is validated by a simple nuclear \nmagnetic resonance experiment in water. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{03.65.-w, 05.30.-d, 76.60.-k}\n\n% 03.65.-w fundamental quantum mechanics\n% 03.67.-a quantum information \n% 05.30.-d Quantum statistical mechanics\n% 76.60.-k Nuclear magnetic resonance and relaxation\n\n%\\begin{multicols}{2}\n\nThe interplay between dissipation and coherent driving \nin the presence of dynamical nonlinearities gives rise to a variety of\nintriguing behaviors.
