Starting from the slave-boson representation with fields\nfor occupied and unoccupied sites, an effective field theory is\nderived in which a complex field corresponds with the order parameter\nof the condensate and a real field with the total density of bosons.\nNear the boundary between the normal and the superfluid phase we obtain\nthe Ginzburg-Landau functional for the superfluid order parameter. \nA mean-field calculation shows that the\ncritical temperature $T_c$ increases with increasing density\nup to a maximum and decreases with further increasing density.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{PACS numbers: 03.75.Fi, 05.30.Jp, 67.40.Db}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\\noindent\nInteracting bosonic quantum systems are of special interest \nbecause of the effect of Bose condensation. The classical\nexample is the Bose-Einstein condensation in an ideal\nBose gas \\cite{bose,einstein",
