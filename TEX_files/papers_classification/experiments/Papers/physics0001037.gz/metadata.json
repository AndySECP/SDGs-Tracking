Such a machine could be the approach of choice to extend\nour discovery reach beyond that of the LHC. More recently, a growing\ncollaboration is exploring the potential of a  stored-muon-beam ``neutrino\nfactory\" to elucidate neutrino oscillations. A neutrino factory could be an\nattractive stepping-stone to a muon collider. Its construction, possibly \nfeasible within the coming decade, could have substantial impact on\nneutrino physics.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\\end{frontmatter}\n\n\\section{Introduction",
