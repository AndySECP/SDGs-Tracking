We show that this\nboundary condition naturally arises from a small extra dimension and present\na complete model which includes a new extra-dimensional solution to the $\\mu$ problem.\nWe briefly discuss the predicted superpartner spectrum as a function of the\ntwo parameters of the model. The commonly ignored renormalization group evolution\nabove the GUT scale is crucial to the viability of Minimal Gaugino Mediation\nbut does not introduce new model dependence.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\newpage\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\section{Introduction",
