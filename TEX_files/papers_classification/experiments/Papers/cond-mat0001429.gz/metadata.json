A very\nefficient method to calculate the resulting expressions in the case of flat\nsurfaces, a method leading to an order reduction in computational\ncomplexity, is presented.  Results for the interaction of two parallel\njellium slabs are shown to agree with those of a recent RPA calculation\n(J.F. Dobson and J. Wang, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 82",
