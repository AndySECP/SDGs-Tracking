Our calculated resistance, which \nshows striking temperature dependent non-monotonicity arising from the \ncompetition among screening, nondegeneracy, and phonon effects, is in \nexcellent agreement with recent experimental data. \n\n\\noindent\nPACS Number : 73.40.-c; 71.30.+h; 73.50.Bk; 73.50.Dn\n\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\\vspace{0.5in",
