The relevant equations are explicitly derived for massless and\nmassive fields arbitrarily coupled to the curvature. In doing so, some\nsemiclassical results, such as the expectation value of the\nstress-energy tensor to linear order in the metric perturbations\nand particle creation effects, are obtained.\nWe then solve the equations and compute the two-point correlation\nfunctions for the linearized Einstein tensor and for the metric\nperturbations. In the conformal field case, explicit results are\nobtained. These results hint that gravitational fluctuations\nin stochastic semiclassical gravity have a ``non-perturbative''\nbehavior in some characteristic correlation lengths. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{04.62.+v, 05.40.+j}\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:introduction}\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\nIt has been pointed out that the semiclassical theory of gravity\n\\cite{wald94,wald77,fulling,birrell,mostepanenko}\ncannot provide a correct\ndescription of the dynamics of the gravitational field \nin situations where the\nquantum stress-energy fluctuations are important\n\\cite{wald94,wald77,birrell,ford82,kuo93,albert1}. \nIn such situations, these\nfluctuations may have relevant back-reaction effects \nin the form of induced gravitational\nfluctuations \\cite{ford82} which, in a certain regime, are expected\nto be described as classical stochastic fluctuations. \nA generalization of the semiclassical\ntheory is thus necessary to account for these effects.\nIn two previous papers, \nRefs.~\\cite{letter} and \\cite{paper_1},\nwe have shown how a stochastic semiclassical theory of\ngravity can be formulated to improve the description of the \ngravitational field when stress-energy fluctuations are relevant.\n\n\nIn Ref.~\\cite{letter}, we adopted an axiomatic approach to construct a\nperturbative generalization of semiclassical gravity which\nincorporates the back reaction  \nof the lowest order stress-energy fluctuations in the form of \na stochastic correction. \nWe started noting that, for \na given solution of semiclassical gravity, the lowest order matter\nstress-energy fluctuations can be associated to a\nclassical stochastic tensor. \nWe then sought a consistent equation in which this \nstochastic tensor was the source of linear perturbations of the\nsemiclassical metric.\nThe equation obtained is the so-called semiclassical \nEinstein-Langevin equation. \n\n\n\nIn Ref.~\\cite{paper_1}, we followed the idea, first proposed\nby Hu \\cite{hu89",
