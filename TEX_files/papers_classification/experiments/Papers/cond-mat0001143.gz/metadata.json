The arrays have a junction capacitance that is much larger %%@\nthan the stray capacitance of the electrodes, which we argue is important %%@\nfor observation of Coulomb blockade.  The Josephson energy can be tuned {\\it %%@\nin situ} and an evolution from Josephson-like to Coulomb blockade behavior %%@\nis observed.  This evolution can be described as a superconducting to %%@\ninsulating, quantum phase transition.  In the Coulomb blockade state, %%@\nhysteretic current-voltage characteristics are described by a dynamic model %%@\nwhich is dual to the resistively shunted junction model of classical %%@\nJosephson junctions.\n\nPACS numbers: 73.40Gk, 74.50+r\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{INTRODUCTION",
