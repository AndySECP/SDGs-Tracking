High\nperformance general-purpose detectors might collect event samples\non the order of a billion events or more. This could greatly improve\non existing analyses of neutrino interactions and also lead to new\nand important analysis topics including, for example, precise\ndeterminations of the CKM matrix elements $\\Vub$ and $\\Vcb$.\nThe potential of such general purpose detectors is illustrated\nwith reference to a previously discussed detector~\\cite{bjkfnal97",
