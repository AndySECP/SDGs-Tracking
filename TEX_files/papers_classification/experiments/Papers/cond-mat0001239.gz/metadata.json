In the last \nsystem, we suggest a Luttinger-liquid-type quasi-metallic state in \nthe crossover region from the band insulator to the Mott insulator. \nWe explain the appearance of this state in terms of the \nincompatibility of the Bragg reflection with the concept of \nLuttinger liquids. \n\\end{abstract",
