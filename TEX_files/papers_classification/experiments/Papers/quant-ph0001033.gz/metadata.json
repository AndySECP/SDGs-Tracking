For weak coupling, the\noutput rate from the condensate and the excited levels in the trap settles\nin  a time proportional to the inverse of the spectral width of\nthe coupling to the output modes. We discuss the properties of the output\natoms in the quasi-steady-state where the population inside the trap is not\nappreciably\ndepleted. We show how the composition of the output\nbeam, containing the condensate and the thermal component, may be\ncontrolled by changing the frequency of the output coupling lasers.\nThis composition determines the first and second order coherence of the\noutput beam. We discuss the changes in the composition of the Bose gas\nleft in the trap and show how non-resonant output coupling can stimulate\neither the evaporation of the thermal excitations in the trap or the growth \nof\nthe non-thermal excitations, when pairs of correlated atoms leave the\ncondensate.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{03.75.Fi, 67.40.Db}\n\n\\section{Introduction",
