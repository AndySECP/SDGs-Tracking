We show that a multivariate\nanalysis using neural networks, that exploits all the information \ncontained within a set\nof event variables, leads to a significant reduction, with respect\nto {\\em any} equivalent conventional analysis, in the integrated\nluminosity required to find a Standard Model Higgs boson in the\nmass range 90 \\gevcc\\ $ < M_H < $ 130 \\gevcc. The luminosity\nreduction is sufficient to bring the discovery of the Higgs boson\nwithin reach of the Fermilab Tevatron experiments, given the anticipated\nintegrated luminosities of Run II, whose scope has recently been\nexpanded. \n\\\\\n\\\\\nPACS Numbers: 14.80.Bn, 13.85.Qk\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n%\\pacs{14.80.Bn, 13.85.Qk}\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n\n\\section{Introduction",
