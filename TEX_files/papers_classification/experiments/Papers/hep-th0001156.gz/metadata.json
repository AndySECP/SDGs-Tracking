These are\ndissipative equations of motion that can exhibit strong chaotic\ndynamics. By choosing very general model parameters leading to symmetry\nbreaking along one of the field directions, the symmetry broken vacua\nmake the role of transitory strange attractors and the field\ntrajectories in phase space are strongly chaotic. Chaos is quantified by\nmeans of the determination of the fractal dimension, which gives an\ninvariant measure for chaotic behavior. Discussions concerning chaos and\ndissipation in the model and possible applications to related problems\nare given.\n\n\n\\vspace{0.34cm",
