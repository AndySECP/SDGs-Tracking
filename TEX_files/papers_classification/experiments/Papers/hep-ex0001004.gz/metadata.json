With 110,000 fully \nreconstructed {\\em D} mesons from experiment E791 at Fermilab, the \ncorrelations are studied as functions of the  $ D\\pi - D $ mass difference \nand of Feynman $ x $. \nWe observe significant correlations which appear to originate\nfrom a combination of sources including fragmentation\ndynamics, resonant decays, and charge of the beam. \\hfill\\break\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{ 13.25.Ft, 13.87.Ce, 13.87.Fh, 14.40.Lb "
