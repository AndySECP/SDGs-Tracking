We critique our analytical theory\nby comparison to numerical solutions of this problem\nand find excellent agreement. By looking at\ncollections of small numbers of such bonds localized\nin some region of a lattice, we demonstrate the stability\nof small ``clusters'' of spins, each cluster having its\nown orientation of its antiferromagnetic order parameter. \nThen, we display a domain wall corresponding to spin twists \nbetween clusters of locally ordered spins showing how spin twists \ncan serve as a mechanism for stripe formation. Since the charges \nare localized in this model, we emphasize that these domain walls \nare produced in a situation for which no kinetic energy is present\nin the problem.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction:}\n\nThe now frequent experimental observations of spin and/or charge \nmodulations in the cuprate superconductors and related doped transition \nmetal oxides \\cite{jtran review} was predicted by the ``frustrated phase \nseparation'' phenomenology of Emery and Kivelson.
