We find that the difference between polarized\n proton-proton and proton-deuteron Drell-Yan cross sections should provide\n valuable information on the polarized flavor asymmetry. Numerical results\n indicate that the asymmetry effects are conspicuous especially in the\n large-$x_F$ region. Our analysis is important for the transversity\n distributions because the flavor asymmetry cannot be found\n by inclusive lepton scattering and W-production processes.}\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\section{Introduction",
