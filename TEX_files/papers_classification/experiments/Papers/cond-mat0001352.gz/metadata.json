The results are discussed in connection with the\npossibility of conventional or\nunconventional superconductivity in the borocarbides. The results are\ncompared to recent tunneling experiments on\nLuNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C.\n\\vskip0.05cm\\medskip \nPACS numbers: 74.70.Ad, 74.20.-z, 74.20.Mn, 74.40.+k\n}}\n\\maketitle\n\\narrowtext\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nIn the early seventies, certain rare earth ternary compounds\nwere found to display superconductivity\nwhile at the same time showed strong tendencies to be magnetic. A large\nbody of theoretical work has been devoted to the interplay of magnetism\nand superconductivity\\cite{review}. Recently, there is\nincreasing evidence that there\nis an interplay of magnetism and superconductivity\nin the boro-carbides\\cite{boro}\nas well as RuSr$_{2}$GdCu$_{2}$O$_{8}$\\cite{ru",
