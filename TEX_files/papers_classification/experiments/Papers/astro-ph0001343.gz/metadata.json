A magnetized white dwarf which rotates\nobliquely relative to the symmetry axis has a mass quadrupole moment\nwhich varies in time, so it will emit gravitational radiation.  LISA\nmay be able to detect the gravitational waves from two nearby, quickly\nrotating white dwarfs.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction",
