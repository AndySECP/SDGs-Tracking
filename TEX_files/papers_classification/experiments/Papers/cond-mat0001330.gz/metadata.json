As\nin the Ohmic case, we predict sharp oscillation of the drag\ncurrent as a function of gate voltage or the chemical potential\nof electrons.  We also study dependence of the drag current on\nthe voltage $V$ across the driving wire. For relatively large\nvalues of $V$ the drag current is proportional to $V^2$.\n\\end{abstract",
