In particular we show that prolonged exposure\nof a critical field configuration to the Ginzburg regime results in no\nsubstantial suppression of the final density of defects formed. \nThese results dismiss the recently proposed role of the Ginzburg regime in \nexplaining the absence of topological defects in  $^4He$ pressure quench\nexperiments. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{PACS Numbers : 05.70.Fh, 11.27.+d, 98.80.Cq \\hfill   LAUR-99-6369}\n\n\\vskip2pc]\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{intro}\n\nThe Ginzburg temperature $T_G$ \\cite{Ginzburg} \nwas thought historically to be the\ndetermining energy scale at which topological defects are formed in the \naftermath of a second order symmetry breaking phase transition \n\\cite{K76,K80,Book",
