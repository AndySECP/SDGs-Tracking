It is based on\nTime-Dependent Density Functional Theory and employs an electronic multiple\nscattering formalism. Incommensurate and commensurate anti-ferromagnetic\nspin fluctuations in paramagnetic $Cr$ and compositionally disordered\n$Cr_{95}V_{5}$ and $Cr_{95}Re_{5}$ alloys are studied together with the\nconnection with the nesting of their Fermi surfaces. We find that the spin\nfluctuations\ncan be described rather simply in terms of an overdamped oscillator model.\nGood agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data is obtained.\n%\n\\end{abstract}\n%\n\\pacs{75.40Gb,75.10Lp,71.15Mb,75.20En"
