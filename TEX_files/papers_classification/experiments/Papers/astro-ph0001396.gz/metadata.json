This pair fireball is deposited via the annihilation of\nneutrino pairs emanating from the surface of the hot neutron star.\nThe heating of neutron stars may occur in close neutron star binary\nsystems near their last stable orbit.  We model the relativistic\nexpansion and subsequent emission of the plasma and find $\\sim 10^{51}\n- 10^{52}$ ergs in $\\gamma$-rays are produced with spectral and\ntemporal properties consistent with observed gamma-ray bursts.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section*{Introduction}\nIt has been speculated for some time that inspiraling neutron stars\ncould provide a power source for cosmological gamma-ray bursts\n\\cite{jwg:mr92,jwg:piran98}.  However, previous Newtonian and\npost-Newtonian studies \\cite{jwg:jr96",
