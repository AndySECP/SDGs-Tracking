Analysis of\nthe spectral and \nspatial details of the electronic structure near a Zn impurity also\nsuggest an effective magnetic component of the impurity\npotential.  Further \nexperiments are proposed to clarify whether the effective\nmoments of nearby impurities are correlated.\n\\end{abstract",
