Models predicting higher D consumption do \nnot reproduce other observed features of our Galaxy.\n \nIf both the primordial D and $^3$He are low, models assuming that 90$\\%$ of \nlow-mass stars experience an extra-mixing\nduring the red giant phase reproduce all the $^3$He observed abundances.\nThe same percentage allows to fit also the observed carbon isotopic ratios,\nthus supporting the self-consistency of the extra-mixing mechanism.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction",
