In the minimalist approach, one adds just enough new stuff to the \nMinimal Standard Model to get $m_\\nu \\neq 0$ and $U_{\\alpha i} \\neq 1$. \nIn the holistic approach, one uses a general framework or principle to \nenlarge the Minimal Standard Model such that, among other things, \n$m_\\nu \\neq 0$ and $U_{\\alpha i} \\neq 1$.  In both cases, there are \nimportant side effects besides neutrino oscillations.  I discuss a \nnumber of examples, including the possibility of leptogenesis from \n$R$ parity nonconservation in supersymmetry.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section*{Introduction}\n\nThere are numerous studies of the neutrino mass matrix for explaining the \ndisappearance and appearance of $\\nu_e$ and $\\nu_\\mu$ in various \nexperiments\\cite{1}.  In this talk, I will only address the theoretical \nissue of how neutrinos obtain mass and the accompanying consequences \nbeyond neutrino oscillations.  The starting point of any such discussion \nis the 1979 observation by Weinberg\\cite{2} that given the particle content \nof the Minimal Standard Model at low energies, neutrinos acquire mass \nonly through the following unique effective dimension-5 operator:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Lambda^{-1",
