We perform a lattice QCD calculation\nof pseudoscalar meson scattering amplitudes,\nignoring quark loops and quark annihilation, and find indications that\nfor sufficiently heavy quarks there is a stable four-quark bound state\nwith $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ and non-exotic flavor quantum numbers.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\narrowtext\n\\newpage\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{section0}\n\nThe light scalar mesons have defied classification for\ndecades \\cite{Caso:1998,Black:1999}. Some are narrow and have been\nfirmly established since the 1960's.  Others are so broad that their\nvery existence is controversial.  Scalar mesons are predicted to be\nchiral partners of the pseudoscalars like the pion, but their role in\nchiral dynamics remains obscure.  Naive quark models interpret them as\norbitally excited $\\qq$ states.  Others have suggested that they are\n$\\qqqq$\\cite{Jaffe:1977} or ``molecular'' states,\\cite{Weinstein:1990}\nstrongly coupled to $\\pi\\pi$ and $\\bar K K$ thresholds.\n\nIn this paper we propose a \nway to shed some light on the nature of the scalar mesons \nusing lattice QCD. Previously scalar mesons have been treated like \nother mesons: their masses have been \nextracted from the large Euclidean time falloff of \n$\\qq-\\qq $ correlation functions with the \nappropriate quantum numbers.  Here we look for a $\\0\\,\\qqqq$ \n\\emph{bound state",
