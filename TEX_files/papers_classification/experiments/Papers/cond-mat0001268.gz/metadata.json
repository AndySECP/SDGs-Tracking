The sets are composed by a number of stock market \nindices located all over the world in five continents. By properly \nselecting the time horizon of returns and by using a reference \ncurrency we find a meaningful taxonomy. The detection of such a \ntaxonomy proves that interpretable information can be stored in \na set of nonsynchronously recorded time series.\n\\end{abstract}\n%----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\pacs{89.70.+c}\n\\vskip1pc]\n\n%\\newpage\n\\narrowtext\n \nOne key aspect of information theory \\cite{Shannon48} is that\nunpredictable time series, namely time series which are not\nor poorly redundant are characterized by statistical properties\nwhich are almost indistinguishable from the ones observed\nin basic random processes such as, for examples, Bernoulli\nor Markov processes.\nWithin this theoretical framework it may appear paradoxical that\nsome time series generated in complex systems, which are playing a\nvital role in biological and economic systems are essentially \nunpredictable and characterized by a negligible or pretty low\nredundancy. Prominent examples are the time series of the price\nchanges of assets traded in a financial markets \n\\cite{Cootner64,Campbell97,MS99,BP2000} \nand the symbolic series of coding regions of DNA \n\\cite{Gatlin66,Mantegna9495",
