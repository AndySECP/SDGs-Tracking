We develop a procedure for computing the\nfull temporal entropy and information of ensembles of neural spike\ntrains, which performs reliably for limited samples of data. This\napproach also yields insight upon the role of correlations between\nspikes in temporal coding mechanisms. The method, when applied to\nrecordings from complex cells of the monkey primary visual cortex,\nresults in lower RMS error information estimates in comparison to\na `brute force' approach. \\vspace{0.2cm} \\noindent PACS numbers:\n87.19.Nn,87.19.La,89.70.+c,07.05.Kf\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{multicols}{2}\n%\\twocolumn\n\nCells in the central nervous system communicate by means of\nstereotypical electrical pulses called action potentials, or spikes\n\\cite{Adr26}. The Shannon information content of neural spike trains\nis fully described by the sequence of times of spike emission. In\nprinciple, the pattern of spike times provides a large capacity for\nconveying information beyond that due to the code commonly assumed by\nphysiologists, the number of spikes fired\n\\cite{Mac+52}. Reliable quantification of this spike timing\ninformation is made difficult by undersampling problems that scale\nwith the number of possible spike patterns, and thus up to\nexponentially with the precision of spike observation (see\nFig.~\\ref{fig:binning",
