In high-resolution $N$-body\nsimulations of both $n=-2$ scale-free and cold dark matter models, we\nfind that $Q$ at late times is not constant but increases with\nwavenumber far into the nonlinear regime.  Self-similar scaling also\ndoes not hold as rigorously for the three-point function as for the\ntwo-point function in the $n=-2$ simulation, perhaps a manifestation\nof the finite simulation volume.\nWe suggest that a better understanding of the two- and three-point\ncorrelation functions in the nonlinear regime lies in the link to the\ndensity profiles of dark matter halos.  We demonstrate and quantify\nhow the slopes of the correlation functions are affected by the slope\nof the halo profiles using simple halo shapes and analytic clustering\nmodels.\n\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{cosmology : theory --- dark matter --- large-scale structure\nof universe --- methods: numerical}\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nIn this {\\it Letter",
