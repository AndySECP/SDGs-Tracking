We show that \nthe electron distribution can deviate from a \nMaxwell-Boltzmann distribution, due to the \neffect of the stochastic energy gain, provided waves \ncan be sustained against damping. The non-thermal \ntail of electrons can generate as bremsstrahlung emission\na flux of hard X-rays compatible with the ones recently detected \nin some clusters of galaxies. \n\\end{abstract}\n{\\it Subject Headings:} galaxies: clusters: general --- X rays: \ntheory --- acceleration of particles\n\n%\\twocolumn\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe recent detection of hard X-rays (Fusco-Femiano et al. 1999\\markcite{fusco};\nKaastra et al. 1999\\markcite{kaastra",
