Besides these frequency\ncomponents, we interpret another peak in the frequency spectrum as an\nindependent quadrupole mode. By this mode identification, we deduce the mass,\nthe evolutionary stage, the rotational frequency, the magnetic field strength,\nand the geometrical configuration of $\\beta$ Cephei.\n\\end{abstract"
