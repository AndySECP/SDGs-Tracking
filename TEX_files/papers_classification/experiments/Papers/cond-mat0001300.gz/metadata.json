The theory is developed starting from a description of the\npropagating Bloch waves on ideal tubes, and   the effects of\nintertube motion are treated  perturbatively in this basis.\nExpressions for the interwall tunneling amplitudes between  states\non neighboring tubes are derived which show the dependence on\nchiral angles and intratube crystal momenta. We find that\nconservation of crystal momentum along the tube direction suppresses \ninterwall coherence in a carbon nanorope containing tubes with\nrandom chiralities. Numerical calculations are presented which\nindicate that electronic states in a rope are localized in the\ntransverse direction with a coherence length corresponding to a\ntube diameter.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{PACS: 72.80.Rj, 73.40.Gk, 61.16.Ch  }\n%\\vskip -0.5 truein\n%]\n\n\\section{Introduction",
