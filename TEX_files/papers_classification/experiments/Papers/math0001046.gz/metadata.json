From this we obtain quantum half-plans, quantum hyperbolic cylinders, quantum hyperbolic paraboloids via Fedosov deformation quantization and finally, the corresponding unitary representations of this group.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n Let us first recall that it was Hermann Weyl(see \\cite{weyl",
