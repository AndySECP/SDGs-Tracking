We demonstrate that, like prompt\nphoton production, lepton pair production is dominated by quark-gluon\nscattering in the region $Q_T>Q/2$. This feature leads to sensitivity to the \ngluon density in kinematical regimes accessible in collider and \nfixed target experiments, and it provides a new independent method for \nconstraining the gluon density.\n\\end{abstract",
