The fluence duration bias does not manifest itself by \naltering the trigger rate, but instead alters measured burst properties. Elsewhere in this conference \\cite{hakkila99} we present evidence that \nthe class of Intermediate bursts identified by statistical clustering \nanalysis \\cite{mukherjee98} can be produced from the hardness vs. \nintensity correlation and the fluence duration bias. We also demonstrate \nhow the bias can be responsible for decreasing fluences and durations of \nthe longest low peak flux Class 1 bursts.\nIn this paper, we describe the fluence duration bias in more detail.\n\n\\section*{An Example}\n\nFigure \\ref{fig1",
