One protocol uses four mutually\nunbiased bases and appears to provide better security than\nobtainable with 2-state carriers. Another possible method allows quantum\nstates to belong to more  than one basis. The security is not better,\nbut many curious features arise. \\end{abstract}\n\n\\bigskip\n\\pacs{PACS numbers: 03.67.-a, 03.67.Dd, 03.65.Bz",
