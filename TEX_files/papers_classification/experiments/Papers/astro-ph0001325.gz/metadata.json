As an example, we model a lens\ncandidate found in the southern Hubble Deep Field. The system consists\nof a source galaxy lensed into an arc, $0\\farcs9$ from an elliptical\ngalaxy. The photometric redshift of 0.6 for the lens galaxy implies a\nmass-to-light ratio of 15 in solar units, out to three effective\nradii. This lens system may be a preview of the large number of lensed\nhigh-redshift galaxies that will be detected with the Next Generation\nSpace Telescope ({\\it NGST",
