The\nsingle strange pseudoscalar and vector meson loop fluctuations of the\nconstituent $u$- and $d$-quarks give rise to only very small \nstrangeness form factors for the proton. This result is in line\nwith recent experimental results, given their wide uncertainty range.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{12.39.-x, 12.39.Ki, 14.20.Dh}\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe HAPPEX experiment \\cite{Happex",
