Experiments with 532 nm, 15 nsec duration laser pulses show\nthat optical limiting occurs mainly due to nonlinear scattering. The\nobserved host liquid dependence of optical limiting in different\nsuspensions suggests that the scattering originates from microbubbles\nformed due to absorption-induced heating.\n\n\n\n{\\section{ Introduction}}\n\nCarbon nanotubes provide a unique class of nanostructured\nmaterials. Improved methods of synthesis, purification and\nfunctionalization have triggered many experiments exploring basic\nphysics of mesoscopic objects as well as various possible applications\n[1-4].
