The bound states are found in different nuclei ranging from \n$^3He$ to $^{208}Pb$. These bound states may have a direct bearing on the \nrecent experiments on the photoproduction of $\\rho$ meson in the nuclear \nmedium.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{24.85.+p, 12.38.Qk, 14.40.Cs, 25.20.Lj}\n\nThe properties of hadrons in the nuclear medium is a field of current interest. \nThese properties at high density and/or temperature are important for the study\nof neutron stars and supernovae. The possible explanations of the experimental \nresults of heavy ion collisions will also depend on the in-medium behaviour of \nthe hadrons. The recent observation of enhanced dilepton production in the \nlow invariant mass domain in heavy ion collider experiments \\cite{1} has \ntriggered speculation \\cite{2} that the effective $\\rho$- meson mass decreases\nin the nuclear medium. The studies using Chiral perturbation theory shows\nthat even at finite densities there may be a partial restoration of chiral\nsymmetry leading to the decrease of vector meson masses from their free \nvalues \\cite{3}. \n\nA number of experiments have been done to study the possible shift of the \nmasses of vector mesons $\\omega$, $\\eta$ \\cite{4} and $\\rho$ \\cite{5}. The most\nnotable experiments regarding $\\rho$ meson mass modification are \n$K^{+} - {^{12}C}$ elastic cross section measurements at 800 MeV that have \nalso revealed an enhancement which can be attributed to a shift in $\\rho^0$ \nmass \\cite{6}; the need for shifted meson masses to explain the spin transfer in\nthe $\\vec {p}$-$A$ scattering experiment at IUCF \\cite{7",
