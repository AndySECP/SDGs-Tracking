For the power spectra,\nthis approach not only simplifies the calculations\nbut is also readily generalized from the \nusual flat-sky approximation to the exact all-sky\nform by replacing Fourier harmonics with spherical harmonics.\nCounterintuitively, due to the nonlinear nature\nof the effect, errors in the flat-sky approximation \ndo not improve on smaller scales.  They remain at the\n10\\% level through the acoustic regime and are sufficiently\nlarge to merit adoption of the all-sky formalism.  \nFor the bispectra, a cosmic variance limited\ndetection of the correlation with secondary anisotropies \nhas an order of magnitude greater signal-to-noise \nfor combinations involving magnetic parity polarization than \nthose involving the temperature alone.\nDetection of these bispectra\nwill however be severely noise and foreground limited even with\nthe Planck satellite, leaving room for improvement with\nhigher sensitivity experiments.   We also provide a general\nstudy of the correspondence between flat and all sky potentials,\ndeflection angles, convergence and shear for the power spectra and \nbispectra.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\vskip 0.5truecm\n]\n\n\\section{Introduction",
