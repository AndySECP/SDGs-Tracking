We find a\nnew term in the free energy, additional to those present in the conventional\nunitary $\\sigma $-model, whose presence relies on the long-range nature of\nthe disorder correlations. Under a perturbative renormalization group\nanalysis of the free energy, the new term contributes to the scaling\nfunction at one-loop order and leads to antilocalization.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{PACS numbers: 72.15.Rn,73.20Fz,73.23.-b}\n\n\\vspace{-0.4cm}\n\n\\begin{multicols}{2}  \n\nA question of long-standing controversy has been the influence of a random,\nstatic magnetic field on a two-dimensional electron gas. This problem is\nrelevant to a wide range of physical situations, including the quantum Hall\neffect in the half-filled Landau level \\cite{KalHalp} and high-Tc\nsuperconductivity in the gauge-field description \\cite{IofNag}. Following\nthe application of a succession of analytical methods to this problem (e.g.\n\\cite{Alt",
