We\n  examine the behaviour of the phase of the Higgs field after\n  two-bubble collisions, and find that phase differences equilibrate\n  much more quickly in slow-moving bubbles than in those which expand\n  at the speed of light.  This could lead to a significant reduction\n  in the initial density of topological defects formed at a\n  first-order phase transition.}\n\n\n\\section{Introduction",
