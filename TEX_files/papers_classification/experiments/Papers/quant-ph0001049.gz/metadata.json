A number of such pairs of Hamiltonians share an\nintegrability condition called shape invariance \\cite{ref3}. Although\nnot all exactly-solvable problems are shape-invariant \\cite{ref4},\nshape invariance, especially in its algebraic formulation\n\\cite{ref5,ref6,ref7}, is a powerful technique to study\nexactly-solvable systems. \n\nSupersymmetric quantum mechanics is generally studied in the context\nof one-dimensional systems.
