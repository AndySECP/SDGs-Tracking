The relaxation in this new time scale, which appears in an intermediate time window, is a power law and is related to self organization of the magnetic flux around the critical current density $J_c$ during the relaxation. Emergence of a new time scale which along with the time scale for long time relaxation due to thermally activated process dynamically identifies the irreversibility temperature.\n\\vspace{1pc}\n\\end{abstract",
