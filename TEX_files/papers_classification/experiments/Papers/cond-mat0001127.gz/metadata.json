The occurrence of a\nfinite-temperature chiral-glass transition \nwithout the conventional spin-glass order is established.\nCritical exponents characterizing the transition are\ndifferent from those of the standard Ising spin glass.\nThe calculated overlap distribution suggests the appearance of\na peculiar type of replica-symmetry breaking\nin the chiral-glass ordered state.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\begin{multicols}{2",
