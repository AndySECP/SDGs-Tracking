We use a number of models involving a single particle moving\nin two dimensions and colliding with fixed scatterers.  We find that a number\nof microscopically nonchaotic models exhibit diffusion,\nand that the standard methods of\nchaotic time series analysis are ill suited to the problem of distinguishing\nbetween chaotic and nonchaotic microscopic dynamics.\nHowever, we show that periodic orbits\nplay an important role in our models, in that their different properties\nin our chaotic and nonchaotic models can be used to distinguish them\nat the level of time series analysis, and in systems with absorbing boundaries.\nOur findings are relevant to experiments aimed at verifying the existence of\nchaoticity and related dynamical properties on a microscopic level\nin diffusive systems.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nIt is generally assumed that diffusion in macroscopic systems is a result\nof chaos on a microscopic scale, following Einstein's 1905 explanation\nfor Brownian motion, that is, the movement of a colloidal particle due\nto thermal fluctuations in the surrounding fluid.  \nWe describe chaos, diffusion and related properties in detail in\nSec.~\\ref{s:fund",
