The deflector centroid\nin the models matches the optical galaxy position,\nand the quadrupoles are aligned\nwith the optical isophotes. The radial distribution of mass could not\nbe well constrained. We discuss the implications of these models for the\ndeflector mass distribution and for\nthe predicted time delays between lensed components.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{gravitational lensing --- methods: data analysis --- galaxies: structure}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nThere are now about 40 observed examples\nof ``strong'' gravitational lensing,\nin which multiple images of a background object are produced by the\ngravitational potential of an intervening object (\\cite{castles"
