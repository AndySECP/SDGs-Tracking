In this paper we review recent\napplications of the Quantum \\MC\\ methods that we have developed for\nthis purpose.  The reader is referred to other papers for introductory\nor more technical discussions of earlier\nwork.\\cite{NigUmrAdv99,NATO-ASI98,NB96.prl,NB98.prl}\n\n\\section{Mathematical Preliminaries}\nFor an operator $G$, the power method can be used to compute  the\ndominant eigenstate and eigenvalue, $\\ket{\\psi_0}$ and $\\lambda_0$.\n\nThis well-know procedure can be summarized as follows:\n\\begin{enumerate",
