X-rays currently yield cosmologically\ninteresting results on the abundances, evolution and gas content of\nclusters of galaxies, on the clustering and evolution of active\ngalaxies and on the X-ray Background. They are unlikely in the long\nterm future to give the most precise values of the cosmological\nparameters, although in the short term the baryon fraction of clusters\nand the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect will remain important determinants\nand checks for some parameters. X-rays will however continue to play\nan important role in studying the astrophysics of the formation and\ngrowth of black holes, galaxies, groups and clusters. It is possible\nthat this role will be crucial, if winds from active galaxies are\nresponsible for breaking the simple gravitational scaling laws for\nclusters.\n%\n\\end{abstract}\n%\n%\n\n\\section{Introduction"
