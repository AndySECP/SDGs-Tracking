These are the merging rates in compact groups,\nthe properties of remnants of multiple mergers, and the evolution of\ndisc galaxies \nsurrounded by one or more satellites. The short dynamical times of compact\ngroups make it difficult to understand why such groups are observed at\nall. N-body simulations have pointed out two possible classes of\nsolutions to\nthis problem. The first one proposes that there is on-going\nformation of compact groups, \nor that the longevity of the group is due to secondary infall. For the\nsecond class of solutions the longevity of compact groups is due\neither to their specific initial conditions, or to a massive common\nhalo, encompassing the whole group. I discuss here these alternatives,\ntogether with their\nrespective advantages and disadvantages. I then turn to the structure\nof remnants of multiple mergers and \ncompare the results of N-body simulations with the\nproperties of observed elliptical galaxies. Finally I discuss the\ndynamical evolution of a disc galaxy surrounded by one or more\nspherical satellites.  \n\\end{abstract}\n\n% Keywords should be included, but they are not printed in the hardcopy.\n\n\\keywords{small galaxy groups, interactions, mergings, N-body simulations}\n\n\\section{Introduction",
