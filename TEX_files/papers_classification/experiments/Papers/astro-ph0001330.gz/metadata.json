Using spatially resolved, deprojected \\rosat PSPC spectra of\n10 of the brightest cooling flow galaxies and groups with low Galactic\ncolumn densities we have detected intrinsic absorption over energies\n$\\sim 0.4-0.8$ keV at the $2\\sigma/3\\sigma$ level in half of the\nsample. Since no intrinsic absorption is indicated for energies below\n$\\sim 0.4$ keV, the most reasonable model for the absorber is\ncollisionally ionized gas at temperatures $T=10^{5-6",
