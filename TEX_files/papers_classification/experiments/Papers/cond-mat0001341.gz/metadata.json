The laser induces a transition\nfrom an internal state with large negative scattering length to one\nwith almost no interactions. The process can be viewed as a tunneling of\natomic population between the superconducting and the normal states of the\ngas. It can be used to detect the BCS-ground state and to measure the\nsuperconducting order parameter.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{05.30.Fk, 32.80.-t, 74.25.Gz}\n\n\\begin{multicols}{2}[]\n\nSuccessful cooling of trapped Fermionic $^{40}$K atoms down to\ntemperatures where the Fermi degeneracy sets in was reported recently\n\\cite{Jin99,Janne99}. This breakthrough opens up new opportunities for\nstudying fundamental quantum statistical and many-body physics. A\nmajor advantage of Fermionic atoms compared to electrons in condensed\nmatter is the richness of their internal energy structure and the\npossibility to accurately and efficiently manipulate these energy\nstates by laser light and magnetic fields. Furthermore, atomic gases\nare dilute and weakly interacting thus offering the ideal tool for\ndeveloping and experimentally testing theories of many-body quantum physics.\nA major goal is to observe the predicted \\cite{Stoof,You99} BSC-transition\nfor Fermionic atoms -- this would compare to the experimental\nrealization of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates \\cite{Bose",
