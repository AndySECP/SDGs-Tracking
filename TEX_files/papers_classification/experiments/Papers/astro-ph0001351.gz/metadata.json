Our aim\nis to group the information from the binarity on the one hand and the pulsational \ncharacteristics on the other hand for as complete a sample as possible \nof $\\delta$ Scuti stars in stellar systems. A selection of 18 well-documented cases, \ntaking care that every type of binary is being represented, is discussed more extensively.  \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{$\\delta$ Scuti star - variability - pulsation - binarity - physical properties}\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\section{Introduction",
