Here, we present a \ncomprehensive analysis for the determination of sneutrino \nvacuum expectation values from the one-loop effective scalar potential, \nand also for the one-loop renormalization of neutrino masses and mixing.  \nApplying our results to theories with gauge mediated supersymmetry \nbreaking, we discuss the effects of the one-loop corrections and\nhow the realistic neutrino mass matrices arise.\n",
