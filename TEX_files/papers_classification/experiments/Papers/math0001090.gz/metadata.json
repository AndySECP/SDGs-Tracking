Using this upper bound\nand minimal polygonal presentations, we give an upper bound in terms of the\nsuperbridge index and the bridge index of the summands when they are torus\nknots.\nIn contrast to the fact that the difference between the sum of bridge indices\nof two knots and the bridge index of their connected sum is always one,\nthe corresponding difference for the superbridge index can be arbitrarily large.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\maketitle\n%\n\\thispagestyle{empty}\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{intro}\nThroughout this article a {\\em knot\\/} is a piecewise smooth simple closed\ncurve embedded in the three dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb R^3$.\nTwo knots are {\\em equivalent\\/} if there is a\npiecewise smooth autohomeomorphism of $\\mathbb R^3$ mapping one knot\nonto the other. The equivalence class of a knot $K$ will be called the\n{\\em knot type\\/} of $K$ and denoted by~$[K]$.\n\nThe {\\em crookedness\\/} of a knot $K$ embedded in $\\mathbb R^3$ with\nrespect to a unit vector $\\vec v$ is the number of connected components of\nthe preimage of the set of local maximum values of the orthogonal projection\n$K\\to \\mathbb R\\vec v$, denoted by $b_{\\vec v",
