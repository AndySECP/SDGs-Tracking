Using density matrix renormalization group methods, they \nestimate the critical exponents, raising the possibility that \nthe transition might belong to the same universality \nclass as branching annihilating random \nwalks with even numbers of offspring. This is surprising\nsince the model does not have an explicit parity-conserving symmetry. \nIn order to understand this contradiction, we\nestimate the critical exponents by Monte Carlo simulations. \nThe results suggest that the transition might belong to a different \nuniversality class that has not been investigated before.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{{\\bf PACS numbers:} 05.70.Ln, 64.60.Ak, 64.60.Ht}]\n%\n% Explanation of PACS numbers:\n% 05.70.Ln: Nonequilibrium and irreversible processes\n% 64.60.Ak: order-disorder phase transitions / percolation transitions\n% 64.60.Ht: dynamic critical phenomena\n\n% -------------------- Introductory part ------------------------\n\nSymmetries and conservation laws are known to\nplay an important role in the theory of\nnonequilibrium critical phenomena~\\cite{MarroDickman99",
