All involve the failure of neutrino energy deposition\nto launch a strong supernova explosion.  A key\nquantity which determines the type of high energy transient produced\nis the ratio of the engine operation time, $\\rm t_{engine}$, to the\ntime for the explosion to break out of the stellar surface, $\\rm\nt_{bo}$.  Stars with sufficient angular momentum produce collapsars --\nblack holes accreting rapidly through a disk -- in their centers.\nCollapsars can occur in stars with a wide range of radii depending on\nthe amount of pre-collapse mass loss.  The stellar radius and jet\nproperties determine the degree of beaming of the explosion.  In some\ncases the stellar envelope serves to focus the explosion to narrow\nbeaming angles.  The baryon loading of various models for classical\nGRBs formed in massive stars is examined and the consequences are\nexplored.  For $\\rm t_{engine} > t_{bo",
