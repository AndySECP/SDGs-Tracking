A simple way to extract all necessary\ninformation from the deflection function alone without having to\ncompute the stability matrix is described. This includes the determination\nof the relevant Maslov indices. Results of singlet and triplet cross sections\nfor excitation and ionization are reported. The different levels\nof approximation -- classical, semiclassical, and uniform semiclassical --\nare compared among each other and to the full quantum result.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{34.80D, 03.65.Sq, 34.10+x}\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% text %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nSemiclassical scattering theory was formulated almost  40 years ago for\npotential scattering in terms of WKB-phaseshifts \\cite{FoW59}.\nTen years later, a multidimensional  formulation appeared, derived from the \nFeynman path integral  \\cite{Pec69}.  Based on a similar derivation\nMiller developed at about the same time his 'classical S-matrix' which\nextended  Pechukas' multidimensional semiclassical S-matrix  for potential\nscattering to inelastic scattering \\cite{Mil70,Mil70a,Mil74}.\nThese semiclassical concepts have been mostly applied to molecular \nproblems, and in a parallel development by Balian and Bloch \\cite{BaBl74",
