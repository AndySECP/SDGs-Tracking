Following previous studies, the\nearly light curve is modeled using a $t^2$ law, which is then mated\nwith a modified Leibundgut template light curve. The best-fit $t^2$\nlaw is determined for ensemble samples of low-- and high--redshift\nsupernovae by fitting simultaneously for all light-curve parameters\nfor all supernovae in each sample.  Our method fully accounts for the\nnon-negligible covariance amongst the light-curve fitting parameters,\nwhich previous analyses have neglected. Contrary to\n\\citet{riess_evol99",
