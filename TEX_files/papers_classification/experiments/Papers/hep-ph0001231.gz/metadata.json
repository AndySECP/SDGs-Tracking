We discuss how the presence of other charges \nor currents may counteract\nthe resonance, but we argue that in some cases the resonance will\npersist and that hence this mechanism could have some\nrelevance for the problem of large scale primordial\nmagnetic fields.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{PACS numbers: 98.80Cq}]\n\n\\vskip 0.4cm\n \n\\section{Introduction",
