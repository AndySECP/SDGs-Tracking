We discuss the validity of this model, in particular in terms of field reversals and radial extensions.\nWe conclude that with such a model one cannot retreive any directional information from the observed direction of the cosmic rays.\nIn particular one cannot identify point sources at least up to energies of about 200~EeV\\footnotemark\\ . Therefore the apparent clustering of the back-traced\nhighest energy cosmic rays observed to date cannot be interpreted as an evidence for a point source nor for the identification of M87, \nwhich happens to be close to the North pole, as being such a source.\n\\vspace{1pc}\n\\end{abstract",
