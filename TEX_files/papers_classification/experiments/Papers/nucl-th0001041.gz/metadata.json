The prescission neutron multiplicities\nand mean kinetic energies of the evaporated neutrons have been calculated\nand compared with the respective experimental data over a wide range of\nexcitation energy and compound nuclear mass. \nThe mean and  the  variance  of  the\ntotal  kinetic energies of the fission fragments have been calculated and\ncompared with the experimental values.\n\n\\end{abstract",
