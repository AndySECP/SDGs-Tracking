The transformation has been incorporated in the \nbasin-hopping algorithm using a two-phase approach.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\begin{multicols}{2}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nOne of the most important types of global optimization problem, and one which is \nparticularly of interest to chemical physicists, is the determination of the \nlowest energy configuration of a molecular system, such as a protein, a crystal or \na cluster.\\cite{WalesS99",
