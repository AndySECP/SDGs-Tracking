We construct the phase diagram for the junction\nand discuss properties of different phases.  In addition, we find the\nsinglet and doublet state energies within a slave boson mean field approach.\nWe find the slave boson mean field treatment is unable to account for the\nlevel crossing.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{PACS numbers: 74.50.+r, 73.40.Gk}\n\\vskip2pc]\n\n\\narrowtext\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe Ambegaokar-Baratoff formula, $I_{\\rm c}=\\pi\\Delta/2eR$, relates the\ncritical current in a Josephson junction to the superconducting gap $\\Delta$\nand the normal state junction resistance $R$.  This result is perturbative\nin the electron tunneling amplitude $t$; the normal state conductance is\nproportional to $|t|^2$ when $t$ is small.  In certain instances, however,\nit may be that the tunneling is mediated through a magnetic impurity,\nrather than taking place directly from one superconductor to the other.\nThis situation has been considered by a number of authors\n\\cite{kulik,SS,BKS,GM,SK,RA,CA}.  The principal result is that magnetic\nimpurity-mediated tunneling results in a {\\it negative\\/} contribution to\n$I_{\\rm c}$.  As Kulik originally argued \\cite{kulik}, the magnetic impurity\ngives rise to an effective spin-flip hopping amplitude $t_{\\rm sf",
