Recent experiments on cobalt utilizing a\ntungsten tip found that the light is circularly polarized;\nthe sense of circular\npolarization depends on the direction of the sample magnetization,\nand the degree of polarization is of order 10 \\%. This raises the\npossibility of constructing a magnetic microscope with very good spatial\nresolution. We present a theory of this effect for iron and cobalt and\nfind a degree of polarization of order 0.1 \\%. This is in disagreement\nwith the experiments on cobalt as well as previous theoretical work\nwhich found order of magnitude agreement with the experimental\nresults. However, a recent experiment on iron showed 0.0 ${\\pm }$2 \\%.\nWe predict that the use of a silver tip would \nincrease the degree of circular polarization for a range of photon\nenergies.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{PACS numbers: 61.16.Ch, 78.20.Ls, 73.20.Mf}\n\n\\begin{multicols}{2}\n%  \\narrowtext\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{SecIntro}\nThe last ten years have seen a rapid development of the field of\nmagnetic dichroism,\nespecially where the response of a system to left and right circularly\npolarized light is probed; so called circular dichroism.\\cite{Dubs",
