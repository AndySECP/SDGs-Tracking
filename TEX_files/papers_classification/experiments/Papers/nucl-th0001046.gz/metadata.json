During the first stage of the deformation\none has a two-center evolution until the neck radius becomes equal to the \nradius of the emitted particle. Then the three center starts developing by\ndecreasing with the same amount the two tip distances. \nIn such a way a second minimum, typical\nfor a cluster molecule, appears in the deformation energy.\nExamples are presented for $^{240}$Pu parent nucleus emitting\n$\\alpha$-particles and $^{14}$C in a ternary process. }\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nFission approach\\cite{p195b96b} to the cluster \nradioactivities\\cite{ps84sjpn80} and $\\alpha $-decay has been\nsystematically developed during the last two decades (see Ref. 1 \n\\nocite{p195b96b",
