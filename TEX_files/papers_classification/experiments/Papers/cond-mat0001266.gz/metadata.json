The source of disorder\nis the stochastic fluctuation of the impurity energy from site to site.\nAlthough the system is one-dimensional and random, we demonstrate analytical\nand numerically the existence of extended states in the neighborhood of a given\nresonant energy, which match that of the host atoms.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{PACS numbers: 73.20.Jc, 73.61.Ph, 73.20.Dx, 72.20.$-$i}\n\n\\narrowtext\n\n\\section{Introduction",
