Quantum effects of phase fluctuations are shown\nto be quantitatively important, but thermal effects are small for\n$T \\ll T_c$. An anisotropic\nsuperfluid Fermi liquid phenomenology is presented for \nthe effect of quasiparticle interactions on the temperature and doping\ndependence of the low $T$ penetration depth.\n\\vspace{1pc}\n\\end{abstract",
