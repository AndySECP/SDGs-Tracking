The multi-band images are de-reddened,\nde-convolved and de-contaminated so that the luminous matter and the surface brightness\ncontours in the Einstein ring are both faithfully mapped. This intensity distribution\ncan then be used to reconstruct the potential. Progress in implementing this program\nis reported.\n\nThe observed incidence of multiple-imaged galaxies on the Hubble Deep Fields is an order \nof magnitude smaller than naively predicted on the basis of radio lens surveys, like CLASS,\nbut consistent with the rate computed using surface photometry of candidate\nlens galaxies assuming standard mass to light ratios. In order to resolve this \nparadox, it is suggested that most galaxy lenses are located in compact groups.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\keywords{cosmology: dark matter---cosmology: distance scale---cosmology: gravitational lensing}\n\\vspace*{-0.4cm}\n\\section{Introduction}\nFor a long while, ({\\it eg",
