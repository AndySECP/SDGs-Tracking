It is shown that coherent 3D islands can be expected \nto form in compressed rather than in expanded overlayers beyond a critical \nlattice misfit. In the latter case the classical Stranski-Krastanov growth \nis expected to occur because the misfit dislocations can become energetically \nfavored at smaller island sizes. The thermodynamic reason for coherent 3D \nislanding is the incomplete wetting owing to the weaker adhesion of the edge \natoms. Monolayer height islands with a critical size appear as necessary \nprecursors of the 3D islands. The latter explains the experimentally observed \nnarrow size distribution of the 3D islands. The 2D-3D transformation takes \nplace by consecutive rearrangements of mono- to bilayer, bi- to trilayer \nislands, etc., after exceeding the corresponding critical sizes. The \nrearrangements are initiated by nucleation events each next one requiring to \novercome a lower energetic barrier. The model is in good qualitative \nagreement with available experimental observations.\n\\end{abstract}\n% \n\\pacs{PACS numbers: 68.35.Bs, 68.55.Jk}\n\n\\twocolumn\n\\section{Introduction",
