We show within the quasiclassical Green's functions technique,\nhow the fundamental SNIS-element of the such structures can be mapped onto \nan effective S$^\\prime$IS-junction, where S$^\\prime$ is the proximised\nmaterial \nwith an effective energy gap $E_g<\\Delta$.  The conductance through such \na sample at $T=0$ vanishes if $V<\\Delta+E_g$, whereas at $T>0$ the\nconductance shows a peak at $V=\\Delta-E_g$. We propose the \nAndreev-Interferometer, where $E_g$ can be tuned by an external\nphase $\\phi$ and displays maxima at 0 mod $2\\pi$ and minima at $\\pi$\nmod $2\\pi$. This leads to peculiar current-phase-relations, which depart\nfrom a\nzero-phase maximum or minimum depending on the bias voltage and can\neven show intermediate extreme at $V\\approx\\Delta$. We propose an\nexperiment to verify our predictions and show, how our results are\nconsistent with recent, unexplained experimental results.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{}\n]\n\nThe proximity effect, although already known for many decades (see\ne.g. \\onlinecite {degennes:64",
