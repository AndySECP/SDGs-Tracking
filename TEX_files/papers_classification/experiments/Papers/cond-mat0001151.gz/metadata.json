We show that the\ninduced interactions depend in a non-trivial way on the dielectric constants\nof membrane and water and show different scaling with distance depending on\nthese properties. The generality of the calculations also allows us to predict \nunder which dielectric conditions the interaction will change sign and\nbecome repulsive.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{68.10.-m, 87.68.+z,87.16.Dg}\n\n\\narrowtext\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:Introduction}\n\nIn recent years there has been a growing interest in electrostatic\nsystems that are dominated by ion fluctuations and ion\ndistributions around larger charged objects.
