In the case of D-branes transverse\nto a torus with $B$-flux the rank reduction is due to a smaller\nnumber of D-branes required by tadpole cancellation conditions \nin the presence of $B$-flux as some of the orientifold planes\nnow have the \nopposite orientifold projection. We point out that T-duality\nin the presence of $B$-flux is more subtle than in the case with\ntrivial $B$-flux, \nand it is precisely consistent with the qualitative difference \nbetween the aforementioned two setups. In the case where both types\nof branes are present, the states in the mixed ({\\em e.g.",
