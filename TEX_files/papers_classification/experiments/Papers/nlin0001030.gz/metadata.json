The bifurcation portrait of\nthe system in two physically relevant parameters exhibits a rich variety of\ndynamical behaviour, including period bubbling and period adding or Farey\nsequences. The complex bifurcation sequences, characterized by Mixed Mode\nOscillations, exhibit partial features of Shilnikov and Gavrilov-Shilnikov\nscenario.  Utilizing the fact that the model has disparate time scales of\ndynamics, we explain the origin of the relaxation oscillations using the\ngeometrical structure of the bent-slow manifold. Based on a local analysis,\nwe calculate the maximum number of small  amplitude oscillations, $s$, \nin the periodic orbit \nof  $L^s$ type, for a given value of the control parameter. This further leads\nto a scaling relation for the small amplitude oscillations. The incomplete\napproach to homoclinicity is shown to be a result of the finite rate of\n`softening' of the eigen values of the saddle focus fixed point. The latter\nis a consequence of the physically relevant constraint of the system which\ntranslates into the occurrence of back-to-back Hopf bifurcation.\n\n\\vspace{0.5cm"
