These issues are\n  considered within the Dyson-Schwinger equation framework,\n  where ultraviolet cut-off regularization\n  can lead to explicit violations of gauge invariance.  As a\n  specific illustration, we consider the electron\n  self-energy in quenched QED$_4$ in both schemes and establish\n  those procedures for which the UV cut-off scheme can be expected to\n  lead to the dimensional regularization results.\n  We also compare results from precise numerical studies using the two\n  types of regularization.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\newpage\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec_intro}\n\n\nIn order to study quantum field theories in the nonperturbative\nregime it is essential to have appropriate regularization\nschemes which respect the symmetries of the underlying theory.\nIn the lattice approach\\cite{Rothe:1992,Montvay:1994,Gupta:1998"
