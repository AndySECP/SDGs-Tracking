We introduce a  generalized Yang-Mills action,\nwhich coincides with the ordinary one on flat surfaces but differs from it\nin its coupling to two-dimensional gravity.\nThe quantization of this theory in the unitary gauge can be consistently\nperformed taking into account all the topological sectors arising from\nthe gauge-fixing procedure. The resulting theory is naturally interpreted\nas a Matrix String Theory, that is as a theory of covering maps from a\ntwo-dimensional world-sheet to the target Riemann surface.\\\\\n\\vskip 8pt\n{\\bf Report-no DFTT 2/2000.} Presented by A.
