Particularly striking are the strong changes\nin dynamic properties that appear to display divergences at\ntemperatures close to -- but beyond -- the lowest temperatures attainable\neither experimentally or in computer simulations. Recent work on slow\nor glassy dynamics in water suggests analogies with simple liquids not\npreviously appreciated, and at the same time highlights some aspects\nthat remain peculiar to water. A comparison of the behavior of water\nwith normal liquids, with respect to its dynamic, thermodynamic and\nstructural changes in the supercooled regime is made by analyzing, via\ncomputer simulations, the properties of local potential energy minima\nsampled by water in supercooled temperatures and pressures.\n\\end{abstract} \n\n\\pacs{}\n\n%\\narrowtext \n\n\\begin{multicols}{2}\n\n\\section{Introduction",
