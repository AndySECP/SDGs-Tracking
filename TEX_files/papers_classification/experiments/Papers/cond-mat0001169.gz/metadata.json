Uniform stripe phases\nare shown to be unstable to the formation of modulations along the stripes,\nso that within the Hartree-Fock approximation the groundstate is a stripe \n{\\it crystal}. Such crystalline states are generically gapped at any finite\nwavevector; however, in the quantum Hall system the interactions of\nmodulations among different stripes is found to be remarkably weak, leading\nto an infinite collection of collective modes with immeasurably small gaps.\nThe resulting long wavelength behavior is derivable from an elastic theory\nfor smectic liquid crystals. Collective modes for the phonon branch are\ncomputed throughout the Brillouin zone, as are spin wave and magnetoplasmon\nmodes. A soft mode in the phonon spectrum is identified for partial filling\nfactors sufficiently far from $1/2$, indicating a second order phase\ntransition. The modes contain several other signatures that should be\nexperimentally observable.\n\nPACS: 73.40.Hm,73.20.Mf,73.20.Dx\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction and Summary of Results}\n\nRecently, it has been discovered\\cite{lilly,du",
