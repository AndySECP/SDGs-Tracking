We mention the spectator breakup, which is described in \nthe post-form DWBA. The relation to other formulations is also indicated.\nAn especially important mechanism is Coulomb dissociation.\nIt is a distinct advantage that the perturbation due to the electric field \nof the nucleus is exactly known. Therefore firm conclusions can be drawn\nfrom such measurements. \nSome new applications of Coulomb dissociation for nuclear astrophysics are \ndiscussed.\n}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nIn general, the dynamics of nuclear breakup reactions can be quite complicated.\nWe wish to discuss in this minireview style some limiting cases, which show \nsome simple features.\nOne may regard the work of Oppenheimer and Phillips in 1935 \\cite{O35,OP35",
