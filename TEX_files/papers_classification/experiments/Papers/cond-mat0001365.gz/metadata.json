In particular, we address the inevitable problem of self-heating near the gap voltage giving dissipation per intrinsic junction  $\\sim 2I_{c}\\Delta $, which can be as large as $\\sim$ 1 mW. \nWe describe two experimental approaches to circumvent the problem of self-heating in IV measurements on small mesa samples of 2212-BSCCO.  Simultaneous dc and temperature measurements have been performed, allowing corrections for heating to be made. Short pulse measurements have also been made, where the IV characteristics and the mesa temperature can be measured on a $\\mu $s time-scale enabling intrinsic IV characteristics to be derived, even in the presence of appreciable self-heating. Self-heating leads to an appreciable depression of the apparent energy gap and also accounts, in major part, for the s-shaped characteristics often reported at high currents. By correcting for the temperature rise, we derive the intrinsic temperature dependence of the tunnelling characteristics for crystals with a range of doping. Results are compared with recent theoretical models for c-axis transport in d-wave superconductors.\n\\vspace{1pc}\n\\end{abstract",
