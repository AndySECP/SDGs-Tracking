Introduction \n\\section{Introduction}\n\nIn the theory of finite type invariants of knots and links, also\ncalled Vassiliev--Goussarov invariants \\cite{Vassiliev:Cohomology}\n\\cite{Goussarov:ANewForm} \\cite{Birman:NewPoints}\n\\cite{Birman-Lin:KnotPolynomials} \\cite{Bar-Natan:OnTheVassiliev}\n\\cite{Kontsevich:VassilievsKnotInvariants}, we have a descending\nfiltration, called the Vassiliev--Goussarov filtration, on the free\nabelian group generated by ambient isotopy classes of links, and\ndually an ascending filtration on the group of invariants of links\nwith values in an abelian group.  Invariants which lie in the $k$th\nsubgroup in the filtration are characterized by the property that they\nvanish on the $k+1$st subgroup of the Vassiliev--Goussarov filtration,\nand called invariants of type $k$.\n\nIt is natural to ask when the difference of two links lies in the\n$k+1$st subgroup of the Vassiliev--Goussarov filtration, ie, when the\ntwo links are not distinguished by any invariant of type $k$.  If this\nis the case, then the two links are said to be ``$V_k$--equivalent.''\nT~Stanford proved in \\cite{Stanford:BraidCommutators} that two links\nare $V_k$--equivalent if one is obtained from the other by inserting a\npure braid commutator of class $k+1$.  \n%M~Goussarov seems to have\n%proved that the converse holds for knots in $S^3$: Two knots in $S^3$\n%are $V_k$--equivalent if and only if they are related by an element of\n%the $k+1$st lower central series subgroup of some pure braid\n%group.\\footnote{The author has not read Goussarov's proof, and does\n%not know how the proof presented here and Goussarov's are related.}\n%One of the purposes of the present paper is to prove a modified\n%version of this result using calculus of claspers.\n%%>>>\nOne of the main purposes of this paper is to prove a modified version\nof the converse of this result:\n\\begin{theorem}\n\\label{main}\nFor two knots $\\gamma$ and $\\gamma'$ in $S^3$ and for $k\\ge 0$, the\nfollowing conditions are equivalent.\n\\begin{enumerate",
