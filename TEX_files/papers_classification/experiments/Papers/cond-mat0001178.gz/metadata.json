It is conceptually simple, and several of its non--trivial\nproperties can be determined exactly \\cite{mccoy}. However, despite\nnumerous studies, the model seems to be not yet completely\nunderstood.\n\nIn this Letter, we shall deal with the thermal stability of a\ndroplet of minority spins in the two--dimensional Ising\nmodel with {\\it fixed magnetization}, monitoring the transition\nfrom a compact single, macroscopic and extensive droplet at low\ntemperatures to an ensemble of small clusters at\nhigh temperatures. Although related cluster\nequilibrium properties have been studied rather carefully in the\nusual, {\\it grand--canonical} Ising model \\cite{coni,stauffer}, this topic\nseems to have been largely overlooked. Only recently, the\ncorresponding thermal behaviour of an adatom or vacancy island\nof monoatomic height on a crystal surface has been\ninvestigated \\cite{selke",
