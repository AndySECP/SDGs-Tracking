In this phase the effective\npotential between  the elementary quanta of the model is attractive and \nbound states of two or more of them may exist. We give theoretical and\nnumerical evidence for the existence of these bound states. Looking in \nparticular at the Ising model realization of the $\\phi^4$ theory we show,\nby using duality, that\nthese bound states are in one-to-one correspondence with the glueball states of\nthe gauge Ising model. We discuss some interesting consequences of this\nidentification.\n\\\\\nPACS numbers: \n05.50.+q; 75.10.Hk; 11.10.Kk \n\\\\\nPreprint DFTT 4/2000, HU-EP-00/09, ITEP-TH-84/99.\n}}\n\\maketitle\n\\narrowtext\nThree dimensional\nstatistical systems with global $Z_2$ symmetry, the Ising model\nbeing the classic example, lie in the \nuniversality class of the $\\phi^4$ field theory.
