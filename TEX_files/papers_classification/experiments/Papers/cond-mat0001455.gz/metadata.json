Analysis of addition spectra in magnetic field\nallows us to distinguish whether electrons are localized in either\npotential minimum or delocalized over the entire dot. We demonstrate\nthat high magnetic field abruptly splits up a low-density droplet into\ntwo smaller fragments, each residing in a potential minimum. An\nunexplained cancellation of electron repulsion between electrons in\nthese fragments gives rise to paired electron additions.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{PACS numbers: 73.20.Dx, 73.23.Hk, 73.20.Jc}\n\n\\begin{multicols}{2}\n\nFor half a century physicists have worked to understand localization\nof strongly interacting electrons in a disorder potential. Either\nelectron interactions or disorder can produce\nlocalization\\cite{Mott,Anderson}. Though their interplay in\ntwo-dimensional systems has been a subject of intense experimental and\ntheoretical studies\\cite{MIex,MIth}, no theory exists fully describing\nthe effects of both disorder and strong interaction.\n\nQuantum dots provide a convenient system for studying electron\nlocalization on a microscopic scale. However, the traditional\ntransport techniques for studying lateral quantum dots\\cite{MK-R}\nsense primarily delocalized electronic states. A possible exception is\ntransport studies in vertical structures, but these do not permit\nvariation of electron density\\cite{T-SH",
