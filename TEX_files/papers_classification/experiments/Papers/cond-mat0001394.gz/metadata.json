Our results are strongly suggestive of\na breakdown of translational symmetry and the \npresence of crystalline order in the\nground state. This is in sharp contrast with the physics of the lowest and\nfirst excited Landau levels, and in good qualitative agreement\nwith earlier Hartree-Fock studies. Experimental implications of our results \nare discussed.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{73.20.Dx, 73.40.Kp, 73.50.Jt",
