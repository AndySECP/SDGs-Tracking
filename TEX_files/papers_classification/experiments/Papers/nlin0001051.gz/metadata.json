However, most applications of the theory have been to systems\nwhich involve only single particle dynamics. In this work, we develop\na semiclassical formalism to describe the density of states for two\nnoninteracting particles. This includes accounting properly for the\nparticle exchange symmetry. As concrete examples, we study two\nidentical particles in a disk and in a cardioid. In each case, we\ndemonstrate that the semiclassical formalism correctly reproduces the\nquantum densities.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{PACS numbers: 03.65.Sq, 73.40Gk, 05.45.Mt, 05.45.-a}\n\n]\n\n\\section{Introduction}\\label{introduc}\n\n\\noindent Semiclassical physics has experienced a resurgence of\ninterest, largely due to the work of Gutzwiller \\cite{Gutz}, Balian\nand Bloch \\cite{Balian} and Berry and Tabor \\cite{Tabor}.
