The\nscheme involves an avalanche triggering photodetector and a ring cavity\ncoupled to a traveling wave through a cross-Kerr medium. Low quantum\nefficiency at the photodetector improves the synthesizing quality at the\nexpense of reducing the synthesizing rate.\\end{abstract}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\pacs{03.65.Bz, 42.50.-p, 42.50.Dv}\n\\section{Introduction}\nIn the last decade, much attention has been devoted to the quantum\nengineering of nonclassical light. Different types of nonclassical\nstates can be now prepared, and their quantum properties can be\nentirely characterized by accessible measurement schemes. Among the\nvarious quantum states of the optical field, states with a definite\nnumber of photons deserve a special attention. Indeed, besides the\ninterest for fundamental tests of Quantum Mechanics \\cite{pha",
