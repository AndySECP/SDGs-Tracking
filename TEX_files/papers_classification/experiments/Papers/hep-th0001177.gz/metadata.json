In such manifolds, \n  hypersurfaces of constant radius do not blow up \n  uniformly as one increases the radius; examples \n  include products of hyperbolic spaces and the Bergman metric. We\n  find that there is a well-defined correspondence between the IR\n  regulated bulk theory and conformal field theory defined \n  in a background whose degenerate geometry is regulated by the \n  same parameter. We are hence able to make sense of supergravity in\n  backgrounds such as $AdS_{3} \\times H^{2}$. \n}\n\\end{abstract}\n\n% \\narrowtext\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\nFollowing the now famous conjecture of Maldacena \\cite{Ma},\n\\cite{GKP}, \\cite{W1}, \\cite{A} relating supergravity on anti-de Sitter\nspacetimes to a conformal field theory in one less dimension there has\nbeen a great deal of interest in supergravity compactifications on\nanti-de Sitter spaces.\nOne of the most interesting features of the AdS/CFT correspondence is\nthat it provides an example of the holographic principle \\cite{Su}. In\nthe context of the Maldacena conjecture, holography was first\ndiscussed in detail in \\cite{SW} whilst discussions of holography in\ncosmology have appeared in \\cite{FS}, \\cite{Bou}.\n\nHowever, the holographic description of the anti-de Sitter bulk theory\nrelies heavily on special features of the boundary, namely\nthat the conformal boundary in the sense of Penrose \\cite{Pen",
