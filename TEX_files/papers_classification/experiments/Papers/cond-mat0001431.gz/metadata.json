This suppression becomes significant\n  when the spin-orbit scattering rate $\\tau_{\\rm so}^{-1}$ is comparable\n  with the quantum level spacing $\\delta$.  The $g$-factor exhibits\n  mesoscopic fluctuations; at small $\\delta\\tau_{\\rm so}$ it is\n  distributed according to the Maxwell distribution. At $\\delta\\tau_{\\rm\n    so",
