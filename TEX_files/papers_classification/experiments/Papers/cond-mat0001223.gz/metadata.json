Applied to an insulator/conductor binary mixture, it predicts\na percolation-like transition \\cite{KIRK71,CLER90,STAU92,SAHI98} for a\nvolumic fraction of conductor $p_c=1/d$, where $d$ is the space\ndimension. The critical exponents are $s=t=1$, and its critical properties\nare thoroughly discussed in Ref.\\ \\cite{CLER90}. This formula can be\ninterpreted in two ways. On one hand, Milton has shown \\cite{MILT85} that it\nyields the exact effective conductivity of an {\\it ad hoc",
