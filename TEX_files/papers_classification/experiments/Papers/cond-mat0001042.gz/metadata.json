We find\nthat this method does indeed allow to generate accurately the canonical\ndistribution function even at low temperatures and that its efficiency\nis about 10-100 times higher than the usual canonical molecular dynamics\nsimulation.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{PACS numbers: 02.70.Lq, 02.70.Ns, 65.20.+w, 61.43.Fs}\n\n\\begin{multicols}{2",
