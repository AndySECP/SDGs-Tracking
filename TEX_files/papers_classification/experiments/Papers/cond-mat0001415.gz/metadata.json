Using a path integral formulation, we derive\na reduced effective action with long-range impurity spin-spin interactions\nat different imaginary times. In the semiclassical limit, it is\nequivalent to a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain with two-spin,\nthree-spin, etc. long-range interactions, as a generalization of the\ninverse-square long-range Haldane-Shastry model. In this representation\nthe elementary excitations are \"semions\", and the non-Fermi-liquid\nlow-energy properties of the two-channel Kondo model are recovered.\n\n\n{PACS numbers: 72.15.Qm, 71.10.+x, 71.27.+a, 75.20.Hr}\\newline\n\\end{abstract",
