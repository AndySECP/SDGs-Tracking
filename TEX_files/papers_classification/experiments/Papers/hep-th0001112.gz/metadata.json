As an example, \nwe reconsider the problem of stabilizing the dilaton \nin a non-perturbative potential\ninduced by gaugino condensates. A well-known difficulty is that the potential\nis so steep that the dilaton field  \ntends to overrun the correct minimum and to evolve\nto an observationally unacceptable vacuum.\nWe show that the dilaton coupling to the kinetic or\nthermal energy of matter fields \nproduces a natural mechanism for\ngently relaxing the dilaton field into the correct minimum of the potential\nwithout fine-tuning of initial conditions. \nThe same mechanism is potentially relevant for stabilizing other moduli fields.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\nA fundamental problem in supergravity and superstring theories is the stabilization\nof moduli fields, particularly the dilaton.
