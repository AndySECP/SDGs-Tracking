Thus string breaking has remained a widely\npublicized feature of the strong interaction  that has never, apart\nfrom rough models, been reproduced  from the theory. \n\nString breaking can occur  in hadronic decays of $Q\\bar{Q}$ mesons \nand is especially relevant when this meson is lying close to a \nmeson-antimeson ($Q\\bar{q}\\bar{Q",
