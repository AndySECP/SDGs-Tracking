# SDGs-Tracking
Analysis of the progress towards the 17 sustainable development goals set by the United Nations

## Background

*The Sustainable Development Goals are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. They address the global challenges we face, including those related to poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace and justice. The 17 Goals are all interconnected, and in order to leave no one behind, it is important that we achieve them all by 2030.* \

The SDGs aim at being a universal set of indicators that could be used as a reference by UN member states in order to frame their policies by 2030.

## Objectives

**Goal**: Leverage reseaches and published papers to help track progress towards the SDGs Goals and then use knowledges from them (dataset, findings...) to inspire government to develop actionable policies and plans.

### 1. Dataset extraction

Extract datasets that are relevant to the SDG Goals from research papers. Identify their names, how they have been used and where do they come from. Then, classify them into 17 different classes according to their belonging to any or many of the UN Goals. Finally, the objective is to create a search engine for those datasets.

### 2. Classification of papers

Extract and classify all papers that are relevant and help to advance towards the 17 SDG Goals of the United Nation. Then, identify trends in the development of research towards those goals and observe the evolution. Finally, identify direction to move forwards in order to meet the objectives for 2030.

## Resources



## Plan

- **1**: Create a paper classifier by SDG using tex files. Here, the classification is first done using only the frequency of appearance of relevant keywords

- **2**: Leverage NLP to extract mentions of datasets from academic research papers

- **3**: Categorise the extracted dataset under the development goals
